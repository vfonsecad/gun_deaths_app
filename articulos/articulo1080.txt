Pratt of Poughkeepsie Saturday morning in connection with the murder of Scott Myer in Greenville. Pratt has been charged with murder in the first degree, a Class A Felony, according to a New York State Police press release. âThere was an almost around-the-clock investigation from Jan. 1 to today's date," said New York State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation Senior Investigator Scott Youngblood. "We conducted numerous interviews and investigative steps that led to the arrest of Maurice Pratt." The 40-year-old Myer was found dead inside his residence on West Road Jan. 1 when police responded to a call to check on the welfare of the resident. Police report the cause of death as multiple gunshot wounds. Myer was last seen during the days prior to Christmas, according to the press release. Pratt was arrested Saturday morning in Kingston at the Holiday Inn Hotel on Washington Avenue, according to Youngblood. Though the investigation continues, no other suspects are being sought. State Police at Catskill, Kingston and the Troop F Major Crimes Unit conducted the investigation, assisted by the Greene County District Attorneyâs Office, the Greene County Sheriffâs Department, the Village of Catskill Police Department, the City of Poughkeepsie Police Department, the City of Kingston Police Department, and New York State Parole. Pratt was arraigned before Catskill Town Justice William Wootton and remanded to Greene County Jail with no bail. Anyone with information regarding the case is asked to contact the State Police at 518-622-8600.
