1 1   			 90Â° F Deputies were looking for large man driving a distinctive car after the owner of an east Orange County bar was gunned down early Friday. The man who killed 52-year-old Julio Mejia at J & J Sports Bar at 3800 S. Goldenrod Road at 5:30 a.m. fled in a red Nissan Cube, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Office. Witnesses say Mejia was arguing with a 25-year-old bar patron who pulled out a gun and shot the owner several times, deputies said. The shooter was described as 6-feet-2 and 300 pounds. Mejia died on the way to the hospital. Deputies interviewed witnesses who were at the bar during the shooting. But no other details were released Friday. This isn't the first time the bar has been in the news this year. Two days ago, charges against a man who was accused of human trafficking at J & J Bar were dropped. A 17-year-old runaway told authorities the 49-year-old man locked her inside his broken-down van and solicited sex from bar patrons for money for a week or longer. The Department of Children and Families office in Polk County questioned the teen, who told them the man charged a fee for the sex and kept all of the money. The man was accused of bringing three to seven men to the van each night on weekends. He was arrested on April 23 when MBI agents searched the van and found a gun and drugs, the warrant application said. There wasn't enough evidence to prove he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, so the charges were dropped, according to court filings. As a result, the Sentinel is not naming him for this article.
