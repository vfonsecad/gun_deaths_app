By Sun-Star staff                      August  5, 2013                                                          MERCED — A 38-year-old man who was shot to death Saturday in south Merced has been identified as Michael Hernandez, according to the coroner's office. No suspects have been arrested and police are trying to determine the motive and circumstances behind the shooting. Sgt. Scott Skinner said detectives are searching for witnesses in the case, and his department is hoping someone with information will come forward. The shooting happened during daylight hours in a fairly well traveled part of the city.  "It's hard to believe there wasn't a witness to this whole thing," Skinner said. Police responded to the scene at 11th and S streets just before 7 p.m. and found Hernandez lying in the road, suffering from a gunshot wound. Hernandez was taken to Mercy Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Skinner said the victim had some prior contact with law enforcement, but for the most part they were "very minimal." Skinner said it's unknown whether the crime is gang related.  The shooting happened near the location of a double homicide in May. In that case, Alberto Narvaez, 23, and Miguel Narvaez, 27, were shot while standing in the front yard of a home near 12th and S streets. Police said they do not believe the May homicide is linked to Saturday's case. There have been five victims of homicide in Merced this year in four separate cases. Police are asking anyone with information about the case or the shooter to call Detective Chris Russell at (209) 385-4707 or the department automated tip line at (209) 385-4725. Tips are kept confidential and callers can remain anonymous. People can send information via anonymous text messages to the police department by dialing "TIP411" (847411) and including the word "Comvip" as the keyword in the text message.
