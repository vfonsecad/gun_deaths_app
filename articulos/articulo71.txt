Deputies have arrested Brandon Scott, 22, and charged him with one count of homicide and two counts of attempted homicide, said ASO spokesman Lt. Todd Kelly. The incident started at about 7 p.m. Sunday, when an argument broke out between Scott and Timothy Robinson, 34, at Robinsonâs house on the 9800 block of Southwest 162nd Terrace in Archer, according to an ASO news release. The fight escalated when Scott grabbed a rifle and fired at Robinson and two others, Wesley Boykin and Aja Newton. Scott fled from the house before deputies responded to the scene. At about 8 p.m., ASO sent deputies to the house after receiving 911 calls about the shooting. When deputies arrived, they found Boykin, 26, had been shot in the abdomen. Newton, 18, was hit in the arm as well as the abdomen. An ambulance rushed both victims to Shands at UF for treatment. Deputies later found Robinsonâs body about 200 yards away from the scene, according to the release. Deputies said Robinson fled from the house after Scott shot him. At 10:41 p.m., a deputy near the crime scene located and arrested Scott. Deputies later booked Scott into the Alachua County Jail at 2:11 a.m. Monday. Kelly said Boykin and Newton remained in critical care at the hospital Monday afternoon but could not provide further details. As of Monday night, Scott remained in custody without bond.
