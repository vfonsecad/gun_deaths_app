1 1 Roseville police say an argument between roommates led to a shooting this afternoon that left one man dead and another in custody. Police spokeswoman Dee Dee Gunther said police received a report at 3:15 p.m. of someone with a gun in the 100 block of Hickory Street. That was followed by several phone calls from neighbors reporting shots fired. Gunther said officers arrived and found a 54-year-old man in the front yard with gunshot wounds. Roseville Fire Department paramedics pronounced the man dead at the scene. She said the victim's roommate, a 48-year-old man, was located nearby and detained without incident. Officers determined that the shooting followed an argument between the two men. The names of the men have not been released pending notification of the victim's family.
