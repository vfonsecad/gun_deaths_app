But they hope her heart will soon bring life to another girl in need of a transplant. "That will make someone happy," a grieving Richard Lindsey said Thursday evening. Lindsey, the grandfather of Aaliyah Destiny Boyer, said officials at A.I. duPont Hospital for Children in Wilmington, Del., told him Aaliyah's organs could possibly save the lives of 10 children. Aaliyah was struck in the top of her head by a bullet just after midnight Tuesday. She was visiting her mother, Crystal Blackburn, near Elkton, Md., for New Year's Eve and had gone outside to watch fireworks being set off by neighbors. The shot apparently was "celebratory gunfire," said Lt. Michael Holmes, spokesman for the Cecil County Sheriff's Office. Lindsey said ambulance personnel had told family members that the girl probably did not feel pain when she was shot. She immediately dropped to her knees and began to turn blue, Lindsey said. Family members gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and CPR, and paramedics were able to restart her heart. She was taken to the trauma center at Christiana Hospital before being transferred to duPont. Three tests over a three-day period after she was shot showed no brain activity, Lindsey said. Members and pastors of the Manheim Brethren in Christ Church, which the family attended, gathered at the girl's bedside to pray. "We believe in miracles," Lindsey said. "God works in mysterious ways, and we just kept hoping." In the same hospital, they were told, is a 3-year-old girl who is a perfect match for Aaliyah's heart. "That was one of the ways we could keep her alive," he said the family decision to donate her organs. On Thursday, people remembered the H.C. Burgard Elementary School fourth-grader as a vivacious child, full of life. "She was a jolly, happy girl that loved life, and I believe she was doing that right up to the end," said Rose Gehman, who regularly took Aaliyah to church. "Her smile and her personality rubbed off on everyone she met," Gehman said. Dustin Sauder, a youth pastor at Manheim Brethren in Christ, remembered Aaliyah as "bubbly and skipping through the halls." He said the girl enjoyed the church's Kids Club on Wednesdays. "She was known for taking Bible verses and making them into silly songs that everyone could remember," Sauder said. Lindsey said he remembered her standing in front of a blackboard with other children watching her. "Aaliyah was a good child. She always wanted to teach kids," he said. The Manheim Central School District made counselors available at Burgard Elementary on Thursday. In a prepared statement, acting superintendent Fred Cummins also said the district has additional counselors from Intermediate Unit 13 "on standby to support students, staff and parents." Thursday was the students' second day back in class after the holiday break. Lindsey said Aaliyah had lived with him and his wife, Benjie, in their South Charlotte Street home since she was 18 months old. A candlelight vigil will be held to remember her in Manheim Square Saturday from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. "We really want to thank all the people at duPont hospital. They've been tremendous," Lindsey said. He also said he wanted to thank the church members and others who came together to pray for Aaliyah and the family. The church also is helping with the funeral, which had not been scheduled as of Thursday night, he said. It is illegal to fire guns into the air in Maryland, and the Cecil County Sheriff's Office's investigation of the shooting is ongoing, Holmes said. Neighbors in the Old Elk Neck Road and Old Field Point Road areas southwest of Elkton have been interviewed, but no one has been taken into custody, he said. bharris@lnpnews.com          Posted in         News                  on                       Thursday, January 3, 2013 9:08 pm.
