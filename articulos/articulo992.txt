(AP) – The Sangamon County coroner says two people found dead inside a Springfield home were both shot.   Coroner Cinda Edwards tells The (Springfield) State Journal-Register  that an autopsy performed Wednesday found that 24-year-old Larry Grice suffered two gunshot wounds.   Edwards says 24-year-old Andrea Pocklington was shot and also suffered multiple stab wounds. The coroner says she didn’t know which injury caused her death as both could have been fatal.   Edwards adds that Pocklington was five to six months pregnant.   The pair’s bodies were found Monday inside a Springfield apartment. Edwards wasn’t sure when they died, but it could have been the night before they were found.   There’s no word of any arrests.  ___  Information from: The State Journal-Register, http://www.sj-r.com   A place from moms to talk.
