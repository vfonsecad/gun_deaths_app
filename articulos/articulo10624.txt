Willie Bush, 49, of the 1200 block of South Lawndale Avenue, was pronounced dead at 2:04 a.m. at Mount Sinai Hospital, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. Bush was shot multiple times outside his home Saturday, according to the medical examiner's office. An autopsy is scheduled for today. Bush was sitting on his front porch with two other men about 11:35 p.m Saturday when at least three vehicles pulled up to the corner of 13th Street and Lawndale Avenue and a group of people exited, according to Chicago Police Department News Affairs Officer John Mirabelli. The group moved toward Bush and his companions, a 39-year-old man and a 24-year-old man, and someone from the arriving group asked the trio who had beaten up his uncle earlier that day, according to Mirabelli. When Bush and the other two men made no indication they were involved, shots were fired from the group, and the three men were hit, Bush multiple times, said Mirabelli. "Apparently one of those individuals was upset about who had battered his uncle," said Mirabelli. Bush was initially taken in serious condition to Mount Sinai. The 24-year-old was shot in the abdomen and was taken to John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County in serious condition and the 39-year-old was shot in the left thigh and right hand and was taken in serious condition to Mount Sinai, Mirabelli said. Area Central detectives are investigating but no one was in custody Tuesday. rsobol@tribune.com | Twitter: @RosemarySobol1 Copyright Â© 2014 Chicago Tribune Company, LLC Send us your breaking news information, photos and video: tips@tribune.com Get breaking news  email  & text alerts.
