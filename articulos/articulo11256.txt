Park rangers responded to the Grant Village Campground in the southern portion of the park after the child’s parents made a 911 call about the shooting. Rangers found the girl suffering from a gunshot wound. Efforts to resuscitate her were unsuccessful. The identity of the family was not immediately released. The incident remained under investigation Sunday. Visitors to the park are legally allowed to carry guns, but “discharging a firearm for any reason is illegal,” according to the park.
