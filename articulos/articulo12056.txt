1 1 New Orleans - A four-year-old boy and his grandmother were shot in New Orleans East this morning leaving the woman dead and the child hospitalized. The shooting took place at approximately 10:30 a.m. on the 13000 block of Maple Wood Drive. According to NOPD, a bullet grazed the four-year-old's head, but he is currently in the hospital in stable condition.  "The child was coherent," says 7th District Commander Michael Harrison. "Coherent enough to give some information about hearing gunshots and was able to talk to the sergeant when the sergeant asked the child a few questions so they immediately rendered aid to the child to get the child to the hospital as fast as possible." The child's 44-year-old grandmother was shot multiple times and pronounced dead on the scene.  A family member wiped away tears and said she couldn't think of a reason for the shooting. "It's hard to believe something like that would happen to her because she was such a good person," says the woman, who declined to give her name. "She would give you anything, if you asked her she'll give it to you." Investigators say they have a lead but have not made any arrests.
