Video:  2 shot in Brandon, suspect on the loose Video:  Sheriff: Public danger over near Brandon schools Video:  2 people shot in Brandon <c2><a0> <c2><a0>   						   							  							 Brandon, Florida --<c2><a0>Deputies have lifted nearly all of the lockdowns put in place after two men were shot near a school Thursday morning. Sheriff David Gee said he believed all of the key people behind the shooting had been captured by 10:15 a.m. The two men were shot at a duplex on E. Morgan St., near the intersection of Kingsway Rd. and E. Brandon Blvd. It's just 500 feet from Yates Elementary School.<c2><a0>That school remains under a modified lockdown as of 11:30 a.m. Thursday. A full lockdown at Yates had been in place for more than two hours -- beginning just as kids were starting to show up -- turning a place of hopscotch and one-plus-two into a fortress.<c2><a0> "Usually this street is completely full of parents dropping kids off, and you know they had it all shut down right away," said Andrew Willig, whose son Cylis is<c2><a0>in Kindergarten at Yates. Deputies say the two men were shot in a dispute detectives are still working to understand.<c2><a0> Sky 10 watched as one was loaded onto a medevac helicopter. Both men who were shot were taken to local hospitals and one of the victims has potentially life-threatening injuries. And a<c2><a0>few blocks from there, Sky 10 captured a frantic foot chase.<c2><a0> Deputies sweeping the neighborhood started chasing a man. He bolted across sidewalks and through parking lots.<c2><a0>A man leapt out of a car and chased him down, snagging<c2><a0>the fleeing person<c2><a0>from behind and taking him to the ground. We showed the Sky 10 video to a Hillsborough County Sheriff's spokesman and he said while there are plenty of plainclothes deputies on the streets, there's a good chance<c2><a0>the man<c2><a0>who made the takedown was a<c2><a0>civilian.<c2><a0> Now that deputies feel they have the people responsible for the shooting in custody, the spokesman says he's going to check into just who grabbed that guy on the run. That tackled man is one of three men now detained.<c2><a0>Sheriff Gee says he believes they've caught all of the main players in the shooting and the public is no longer at risk. By 9:30 a.m., full buses that had been diverted and held at another school started rolling into Yates. And the school moved to a modified lockdown -- still swarming with deputies -- to start welcoming in students like Cylis, ready to learn. All lockdowns have been lifted for Brooker Elementary School, McLane Middle School, Mann Middle School, and Brandon High School. Nearby Shining Stars Preschool is still limiting pickups and dropoffs.   							Grayson Kamm, 10 News
