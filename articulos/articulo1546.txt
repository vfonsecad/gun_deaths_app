1 1 ISLE OF WIGHT â€“ A 17-year-old boy shot Monday in Isle of Wight has died from his injuries, according to the Isle of Wight Sheriff Office. Deandre Jamar Thomas was shot shortly before 4 p.m. inside a home at 5448 Old Stage Highway, outside Smithfield, according to a Sheriff's Office news release. He was airlifted to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital where he was pronounced dead shortly before 10 p.m. Thomas was enrolled as a student at Smithfield High School but attended the alternative school in Windsor, the release said. Two family members, including Andre Thomas, the teenager's father, at the brick rancher where the shooting occurred declined to discuss the incident or talk about Thomas on Tuesday morning. Thomas died from the gunshot wound and an autopsy was performed on Tuesday, said Isle of Wight Sheriff's Capt. Rick Gaddis. At this point, details as to exactly what happened remain sketchy, he said. Several people, including several children and teenagers, were in the house when the shooting occurred and are being questioned by investigators, Gaddis said. Detectives do not know who fired the weapon and have not ruled out the possibility that the victim or someone else in the room may have accidentally fired the fatal shot, Gaddis said. "All we know for sure is that a young man was killed with a gun," Gaddis said. "Everything else is a mystery right now." Rudolph Jefferson, assistant chief of the Rushmere Volunteer Fire Department, was one of the first responders to arrive at the scene. He said Thomas did not live in the house where he died. Although Jefferson refused to elaborate, he descried the scene when he first arrived as "messy and chaotic." Staff writer Tyra M. Vaughn contributed to this report.
