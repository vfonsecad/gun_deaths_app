Read more WATERLOO, Iowa --- Investigators are still trying to piece together a Saturday morning incident that left a Des Moines man dead from an apparent gunshot wound. Police and paramedics were called to 343 Albany St. at about 2:40 p.m. for a person on the ground and found the body of 26-year-old Anthony Delano Gardner on the front porch. No arrests have been made. Waterloo police have been parked in front of the house around the clock and were still there Monday. Gardner had a Des Moines address, but had acquaintances and possibly a girlfriend in the Waterloo area, said Lt. Michael McNamee with the Waterloo Police Department. He said Gardner apparently knew people at the Albany Street address, and officers have been talking to witnesses to determine what happened. "We're getting different variations and different stories, and there are people we are trying to locate," McNamee said Monday. He said the autopsy was scheduled for Sunday, but he hadn't seen the results. No weapons have been recovered, he said. "We don't think it was a random act. The people involved knew each other," McNamee said. Gardner's death is the fifth shooting death in Waterloo in 2012. On Jan. 5, 17-year-old Martavious Taveros Johnson was shot and killed on Sumner Street when he was approached by a group of people while he climbing into a vehicle. No arrests have been made. On May 2, Kay Straw was shot in a Newell Street home. Her daughter's fiance, Kevin Ambrose, was charged with murder and is awaiting trial. On November 18, Waterloo Police Officer Kyle Law shot Derrick Ambrose Jr., 22, following a disturbance outside a Riehl St. nightclub where Ambrose was seen with a gun and ignored the officer's order to drop the weapon. An investigation by state authorities is ongoing. On Dec. 2, Shantorio Vashawn Evans, 22, was a passenger in a van that was traveling on Broadway Street when someone in a passing car opened fire. No arrests have been made. Â  Copyright 2014 Waterloo Cedar Falls Courier. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
