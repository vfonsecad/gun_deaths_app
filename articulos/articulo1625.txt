The shooter committed suicide around the same time in the La Colonia neighborhood of Oxnard. Gerardo Aguirre watched from an upstairs window as his pregnant fiancee collapsed outside of their Oxnard town home after she and her mother were allegedly shot and killed by Guido Morales Beteta. Adriana Davalos, 22, was expected to give birth to Aguirre’s child next month — they wanted to name her Luna, Aguirre said Friday, two days after the deadly shooting.  Davalos also had two daughters, ages 1 and 3, with Beteta, 54. Aguirre described him as controlling man who had threatened him in the past.  Beteta arrived at the town home Wednesday afternoon and had a verbal argument with Davalos, asking her why she would not answer his calls, Aguirre recalled from overhearing the dispute from the second story of the town home. Davalos had asked him to stay upstairs so he could avoid a fight with Beteta, Aguirre added.  “ ‘Leave me alone, let me be happy,’ ” Aguirre, 36, said he heard his fiancee tell Beteta.  Beteta eventually drove off, Aguirre said in Spanish. Before he left, he spotted Aguirre watching him through the upstairs window. Beteta told Aguirre to count his days because he was going to kill him, he said.   Davalos, uneasy about the threat, made a blocked phone call to Beteta’s house in La Colonia where he lives with his own family to make sure that he had gone home, Aguirre said.  When Beteta answered, he said he was coming back to pick up his two children, Aguirre said.  Beteta returned to the town home when Davalos’ mother, Lucila Davalos, 52, had just returned home from grocery shopping with the 3-year-old. Lucila told Beteta to leave, Aguirre said, then shots were fired.  Aguirre started to run down the stairs after seeing his fiancee fall to the sidewalk, but then he saw Beteta carrying a gun inside the house. Aguirre said he hid in a bedroom while Beteta went into the other upstairs room where there were three men who had just started renting the space. Beteta then fled with the two children, according to Aguirre.  The children, who were unharmed, are in the custody of Javier Figueroa, the oldest brother and son of the female victims, family members said. Oxnard police said they found the two women shot to death when they were called to the 1200 block of Hull Place about 4:35 p.m. Wednesday. Police responded about 30 minutes later to another shooting in the 200 block of South Marquita Street. They found a man later identified as Beteta, dead from a gunshot wound in the backyard of a home.  The Ventura County Medical Examiner’s Office confirmed Beteta as the alleged shooter Friday and reported he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Officials also confirmed the names of the two female victims who both died from a gunshot wound to the back.  Detective Luis McArthur of the Oxnard Police Department said it would be up to the District Attorney to decide if the unborn child should be considered a fourth homicide in the case.    Detectives are waiting on a ballistics report from the medical examiner’s office to compare the bullets from the three individuals to the firearm that was recovered by police at Beteta’s home, McArthur said. Police have not yet confirmed the type of gun the suspect used despite numerous requests by The Star. The shootings are the city’s first homicides this year.  McArthur said detectives are still piecing together the alleged shooter’s family tree. Beteta had at least three adult sons in the U.S. military and twin daughters in high school, McArthur said. A woman who identified herself as Beteta’s daughter on the phone Friday, declined to speak with The Star.   McArthur said investigators plan to look at Beteta’s computer, cellphone records and social media accounts for clues to help establish a timeline in the case. They also plan to examine the children’s birth certificates, child support documents and paternity tests, McArthur said. “It’s complex in the sense that we’re just trying to figure out what prompted him to lash out,” McArthur said. “We’re trying to concretely establish if he’s the father of the two children. We’re all assuming that he is because she told everybody he was but the DNA has to be looked at as well.” McArthur said Friday that investigators are trying to determine a motive.   “It could be a possibility that he was upset about the baby,” he said. “That may have triggered him but we haven’t been able to confirm that.  “One of the angles we’re looking to see is if they were still in a relationship. There’s still a lot of unanswered questions about what moved him to this level.”  Juan Carlos Figueroa, the young woman’s brother, has said his sister and Beteta had a long-term relationship that recently had become tumultuous. And his sister had told Beteta that she wanted to start a new life with her new boyfriend and their baby. Veronica Davalos, 18, said she had been planning on calling friends and family this week to arrange a surprise baby shower for her sister, Adriana. Now, she said, she has been getting in touch with family for a very different reason.  “It’s completely a 180 of what we were expecting,” she said. “We’re going to be strong. We’re going to raise our nieces and we’re going to get through it.” The Davalos family will be holding a carwash to raise money for funeral expenses from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday at Camino Del Sol Park at Camino Del Sol and Rose Avenue.   				 				© 2013 Ventura County Star.
