1   By Bonnie Eslinger Daily News Staff Writer A 45-year-old man was shot and left dying on an East Palo Alto driveway Sunday night, according to police. East Palo Alto police were alerted to the shooting through the city's ShotSpotter detection system, according to a department news release issued Monday. When officers arrived at about 9:55 p.m. to the 1500 block of Bay Road, they found Rodolfo Navarro Balderas lying between two parked cars. He was pronounced dead at the scene, according to police. Sgt. Jeff Liu said Monday police don't have a suspect or motive for the shooting and there's no evidence to suggest the killing was connected to a surge of gang violence in East Palo Alto and Menlo Park in recent months. The two cities have joined forces with the San Mateo County Sheriff's Office and the Palo Alto Police Department in a crackdown against gang violence. "There's nothing to lead us in that direction at this point," Liu said. Sunday's shooting was the seventh homicide in East Palo Alto this year; in 2011 there were eight and in 2010 four.
