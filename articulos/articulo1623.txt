The women were found after officers responded about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday to reports of shots fired in the 1200 block of Hull Place, police said. About 30 minutes later, police received another report of shots fired in the 200 block of Marquita Street. They found a man dead from a gunshot wound. "We have reason to believe that his wound was self-inflicted," Det. Luis McArthur told The Times. He said investigators had not established a motive but suspect that the slayings were related.  "Right now we have no reason to believe there is any immediate threat to public safety," McArthur said.
