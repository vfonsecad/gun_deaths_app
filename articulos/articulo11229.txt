1 1          Police continued searching Saturday for witnesses to a southwest Charlotte shooting where a 21-year-old man was fatally shot after he tried to rob three people. Officers responded to a call around 10 p.m. Friday about shots fired in the 7900 block of Antlers Lane near South Boulevard, according to a police press release. They found shell casings and blood at the scene but couldnât find the person who was shot until the man, Omari Aiken, turned up at CMC-Pineville with a gunshot wound.  Aiken and a second suspect, Duran Rozzelle, 32, went to the apartment complex on Antlers Lane and tried to rob three males at gunpoint, police said. During the robbery, Miguel Antonio Maldonado, 39, and a second person ran away. The suspects then began to assault and fire shots at the third victim, who was unable to run away.  Maldonado returned to the scene with a gun to help the victim and shots were exchanged, police said.  The third victim suffered minor injuries from the assault. After the shooting, police say, someone drove Aiken to a nearby McDonaldâs and left him in the car. That person must have contacted one of his family members, who picked him up and drove him to CMC-Pineville, where he was later pronounced dead, police said.  Rozzelle was found early Saturday at a Gastonia hospital suffering from non-life threatening injuries sustained from an apparent gunshot wound. Rozzelle has been charged with attempted armed robbery, police said. After he is released from the hospital, he will be taken to the Mecklenburg County Sheriffâs Office where he will remain in custody.  Police interviewed Maldonado, who is not being charged at this time. Detectives will present the case to the District Attorneyâs Office for review. Detectives are looking to talk to witnesses. Anyone with information about the shooting can call 704-432-8477 to speak with a homicide detective, call Crime Stoppers at 704-334-1600, or visit charlottecrimestoppers.com.
