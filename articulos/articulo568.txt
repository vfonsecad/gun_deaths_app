The man was shot about 11:45 p.m. Wednesdayin the 1600 block of South 16th Avenue in Maywood, according to town spokesman Larry Shapiro.   Officers found Deshasian Pate, who lived in that block, shot three times -- twice in the left arm and once in the chest, Shapiro said.    Pate had just gone shopping with his 59-year-old mother, and the two were unloading grocery bags from their car at the time of the shooting, Shapiro said. A gunman walked up to Pate, did not say anything then pened fire.   Police believe Pate was targeted, and this was not a random shooting. Nothing was taken from him and no robbery was involved, Shapiro said.    When she heard the gunshots, Pate’s mother ran, fell and broke her arm, Shapiro said. She remained at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood as of Thursday morning.   Her son was also taken to Loyola Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:06 a.m., the medical examiner’s office said.   Maywood police continued to investigate the shooting Thursday and no one was in custody.
