1 The Sacramento County Coroner's office has released the name of a man killed a week ago by a resident in the Hagginwood neighborhood of north Sacramento. The dead man has been identified as Raymont Dwayne Sears, 50, of Sacramento. Information released by Sacramento police at the time of the crime, Jan. 20, described the confrontation that led to the death of Sears: At about 3:30 p.m., a woman reported that her husband had just shot an intruder in their yard in the 3100 block of Palmer Street. The residents were preparing to drive away from their home, and the husband was unlocking a gate at the end of the driveway. Sears walked onto their driveway "acting irrationally," police said. The resident told him to leave, and Sears made comments about getting into their car and began arguing with the resident. The woman was in the car. The intruder walked through the gate onto the property, as the resident kept ordering him to leave. Sears eventually crossed the street. The husband continued preparing to leave. Sears turned with a cane in his hand, and "began to unclothe as if to fight and aggressively came toward the resident again," the release said. The resident retreated to his yard and armed himself with a two-by-four. Sears started breaking objects in the yard and swinging his cane and threw "large and dangerous" objects at the resident, it said. The resident ran into his home, grabbed a gun and ordered Sears to leave. Sears picked up a heavy wrought iron stand and motioned as if to throw it at the resident. The resident fired a round that struck Sears in the abdomen. He died at the hospital shortly before midnight the same day. The resident was not arrested.
