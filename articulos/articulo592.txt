1 Authorities have established a link between a fatal shooting and an armed robbery at a north Shreveport ATM Thursday. Just before 12:30 a.m. Thursday, Shreveport police were dispatched to an alleged robbery of an individual at a Regions Bank ATM in the 1600 block of North Market Street. When officers arrived, an adult male victim told them that as he was using the ATM, a pair of men, one of whom was allegedly armed with a handgun. the men demanded that the victim withdraw money from the ATM or he would be shot. During the robbery, the victim, who was also armed, retrieved his own gun and fired a shot at the two suspects, who fled the scene. Claiming he acted in self-defense, the victim told police he was not certain if he had actually struck one of the would-be robbers. Moments after receiving the armed robbery report, authorities received a call from a local hospital regarding a man suffering an apparent gunshot wound who had just been dropped off at the emergency room. The man, identified as 22-year-old Ledarius Morgan of Shreveport, died shortly after his arrival at the hospital.  Authorities with the Shreveport Police Department's Tactical Robbery Unit and Violent Crimes Unit uncovered information connecting both Morgan and 20-year-old Raymond Johnson of Shreveport to the robbery. Investigators found Johnson at an apartment home in the 1600 block of Barton Drive in Shreveport.  Following questioning at police headquarters, Johnson was booked into the Shreveport City Jail on one count of armed robbery.  The findings of the investigation will be forwarded to the Caddo Parish District Attorney's Office for review to determine if the victim will face any criminal charges. Copyright 2012 KSLA.
