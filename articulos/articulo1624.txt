1 1   Investigators are still trying to determine the motive for Wednesday's shooting, according to Detective Luis McArthur.      Juan Carlos Figueroa told the Ventura County Star ( http://bit.ly/XoET7p) that the victims were his sister Adriana Davalos, 22, and their mother Lucila Davalos, 52.      Adriana Davalos, who was pregnant and due to give birth next month, was found on a walkway at a townhome complex. Lucila Davalos was found a few feet inside a home, police said.      A half-hour later, officers found a man in his late 50s dead in a backyard about two miles away.      A murder-suicide is suspected based on eyewitness accounts of the shooter and prior calls to the police involving the suspect, McArthur said.      The suspect is believed to be the father of two children with Adriana Davalos, but their most recent relationship status is unclear, McArthur said.      Both children lived with their mother and are in protective custody. They were not harmed in the shooting and it's unclear if they were home at the time.      Oxnard is about 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles.      ———      Information from: Ventura County Star, http://venturacountystar.com
