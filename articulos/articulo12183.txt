Sgt. Chris Widmer with the Tucson Police Department tells KGUN9 that Stanford Bell, 18, and Javohn Milne, 20, were shot around 2:30 a.m. Saturday in the 7900 block of East Senate Street, near Golf Links Road and Pantano Road. Officers located the two men suffering at the scene from gun shot wounds. Paramedics pronounced one of the men dead at the scene, according to Widmer.  Paramedics transported the other man to the hospital, where he later died from his injuries, Widmer said. Widmer says a third shooting victim arrived at the hospital before police arrived at the scene. He is suffering from life-threatening injuries.  During the investigation, homicide detectives determined that there was a party at a home on Senate Street. A fight ensued in front of the home and someone started shooting, according to Widmer. A felony warrant is now out for Carson's arrest.  He faces two counts of second degree murder and one count of aggravated assault.
