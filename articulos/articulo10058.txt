Three of the homicides were part of a "rash of violence"  investigators believe is related to gang activity in Salinas, police Sgt.  Jeffrey Gibson said. The latest murder was not gang-related and took place during the  attempted robbery of a 99-cent store in Salinas, Gibson said. Police were dispatched to the store at 102 E. Laurel Drive at 5:11  p.m. Thursday on a report of a man stabbing a store employee, Gibson said. An officer reached the store and witnessed the suspect, Richard  Gutierrez, 22, running out the front door. The officer quickly took Gutierrez into custody on suspicion of  homicide and attempted robbery. The suspect had been seen coming in and out of the store several  times, then stood in a checkout aisle and grabbed an employee. During a  struggle, he allegedly stabbed the employee multiple times, Gibson said. Patrons tried to subdue Gutierrez by throwing canned goods at him,  but he ran out of the store and then encountered the responding officer. The employee was taken to a hospital where he died of his  injuries. Police today were still in the process of notifying the victim's  family members and were not yet releasing his name, Gibson said. The homicide comes after a spate of suspected gang-related deaths,  the most recent of which occurred shortly before 4 p.m. Monday when a  60-year-old man was hit multiple times from gunshots from a semi-automatic  rifle inside a house in the 200 block of Osage Drive. The man, a carpenter who did not live at the house, was doing work  at the home when he was shot. Two Hispanic males were reportedly seen running  from the scene and police believe the crime was gang-related, Gibson said. On Sunday, police responded to a call at 7:55 a.m. at the Willow  Lodge motel at 719 S. Main St. about a gunshot, explosion and possible fire  in one of the rooms. Police and firefighters arrived and found a small fire inside the  room and evidence of an explosion. Officers also located the body of a woman who had been shot to  death. Police suspect that death was also the result of gang activity, Gibson  said. On July 24, police got a report at 10:26 p.m. of a shooting victim  near the intersection of Sieber and Orchard avenues. A 15-year-old boy who  had been shot multiple times was pronounced dead at the scene. Police also consider the homicide as gang-related, Gibson said. A gray Honda Accord car was seen driving away from the scene of  the shooting, police said. Along with the gang  violence, a 30-year-old man was shot and  killed on July 26 by nine members of a police task force after he fired a  shot and then pointed two guns at an officer. Juan Louis Acuna, 30, of Salinas, a wanted parolee with past gang  affiliations, was killed in the officer-involved shooting, which happened at  about 6 p.m. near Ivy and East Market streets.    © 2014 Cox Media Group.
