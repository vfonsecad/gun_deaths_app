The woman, whose name has not been released, was discovered about 5:40 a.m. at the restaurant on Bonneval Road just west of Interstate 95 and off Butler Boulevard. She was in the driver’s seat of the truck and witnesses initially thought she was sleeping, said Sgt. Shawn Coarsey of the Sheriff’s Office. He said the drive-through at the restaurant was open all night but that no one heard gunshots. The woman was a roving security guard who was scheduled to get off at 6 a.m. The McDonald’s was not part of her security route, Coarsey said. “Right now we don’t have a motive,” he said. “It could be robbery, we don’t know.” PREV Pete's Retreat Cyber Cafe reopens in Jacksonville following gaming crackdown NEXT Nassau County man charged with multiple Hilliard arsons please read our user agreement and privacy policy before posting Annie1 Condolences to this woman's family.  Jacksonville is The Murder Capital of Florida.  If it doesn't change people will begin to move away from Jacksonville & this city may become another Detroit.  Violent criminals are coddled and given plea deals so they can get out and commit more violent crimes. In the days of the wild west the good guys could retaliate.  In today's PC world there is a protected class.  That protected class is the violent offender who kills for money or even for no discernible reason at all. "You dress good, you look good. You look good, you feel good. You feel good, you play good. You play good, they pay good!". - Deion Sanders Actually, the violent crime rate is at a 41 year low in Jacksonville. It would be nice to use some facts. Also, Angela Corey is known as being VERY stern when prosecuting - her office does not coddle criminals that's for sure. No, she goes after innocent people and then calls them murders when she can't convict them even after withholding evidence. How can anyone offer praise to Ms. Corey at a time like this.  Just look at what her actions have caused.  I think she needs suspending without pay while she is investigated. we still lead the state in murders. no one can compete with the thugs in this town. all I can say is be prepared to protect your self by any means possible. I think we'll find out this was a drug deal. See Golden Corral. Hopefully there are pictures available from someone's security.   " Your stereotype thanks you for your support!" If Iam correct, this was a security guard for the large school next door. I've seen them roaming the parking lot in their little security truck. At any time if day- in that parking lot you can see some very scary looking individuals. Highly doubt this was some "drug deal". Annie1 fsu813 - You need to use some facts.  The number of people MURDERED in Duval County increased from 76 in 2011 to 94 in 2012. http://www.news4jax.com/news/report-fla-crime-rate-lowest-in-42-years/-/... Anne1: FSU813 said that the violent crime rate is the lowest in 41 years just like the story said.. Annie1 Kal El -- yes he/she said that.  The story, as it relates to our current Murder Capital of Florida rating, shows my point that in Duval County  there were 94 MURDERS  in 2012 compared to 76 murders in 2011.  Not exactly an improvement.  Also, that article was showing an "improvement" for ALL of Florida. My condolences and prayers for the lady.  Hope that the perp will be caught and locked up.  Regarding the recent spike in violent crime it seems that Jacksonville is a city out of control thanks to the lack of leadership downtown. Between the mayor, city council, and sheriff little is done to provide safety. All collect fat paychecks but deliver nothing.  Social services, libraries, street lights, parks, children programs, safety, etc have been greatly cut while money is wasted on electronic bill boards for the stadium, bonuses for JEA, pseudo economic trips abroad, and pension padding for the state attorney.  Corey likes to overcharge to get plea deals. This is a flawed costly approach like a bull in a china shop taking down innocent and guilty alike. Why not focus on the serious and dangerous offenders instead of overcharging all across the board. Is it time to elect new leaders in Jacksonville. If the Police would simply start stopping and questioning people that look suspicious it would probably stop some of this needless crap!  They need to stop EVERYONE, it doesn't matter what sex color/race they are!  If they look suspicious stop and ask what they are doing. This is what the mayor and city council wants. They are responsible. Look at what they have done and are trying to do to public safety. The leadership in this town is a joke. Who would want to move a family to Jacksonville?  Failing schools, murder capitol of Florida, a mayor and council who can't get along and a paper that plays politics instead of reporting the truth. A simple google search and you will keep going right past Jacksonville. sandbiskit First, my condolences and sympathy to this woman's family and friends.  Second, this article has raised some questions - the woman was found in her vehicle at 5:40 a.m.;  she was not due to get off work until 6 am, and this location was not one of her routes.  So she was away from her assignment for at least 20 minutes;  did she meet someone there for some reason?  Did that party turn out to be the shooter? @MikeatBeaches you can't just stop people because you think they look suspicious, you cannot do it.......that will lead to more trouble..... For all those pointing the finger at Angela Corey she is doing an excellent job its the juries that are falling short and the judges that are not putting the criminals away for good........ Who really knows what happened in this incident...... Note to Editors- perhaps worth researching and reporting on aspects many wonder about:Crime 'rate' indeed may be 'down'- incidence of firearm discharge seems to be up, incident core location area expanding. Yeah, libs be danged, we need high def cameras everywhere. Maybe that's ONE thing we can use from that 'big brother' thing. And hide them so the thugs can't disable them. Ah! Mr. Watson DONE IT IN THE PARKING LOT AT BURGER KING WITH A CANDLE STICK AND THE BUTLER DROVE HER OVER TO MCDONALDS. Statistics aside, and most of us know how they can be manipulated, the perception is that things have gotten more violent and dangerous in our city. Anybody who has been to human relations classes, as the Sheriff and Police "brass" surely have, know the importance of perception. "MikeatBeaches" is right, and I am not talking about any profiling by race. Those of us who are white and of a certain age can well recall City Police, County Road Patrol, and Beaches Police departments stopping us if we even appeared to be up to no good, or even just aimless. They would often make contact cards or notes of such contacts, and if an incident occurred later, they had something to go on. It made people aware that law enforcement was actively watching things. Abuses? Sure on occasion, but I would prefer it to the zombies who now roam even the better neighborhoods quite freely. Once again, real or perceived, this problem of violent crime, and the drug problem can well cost our city more than pensions, scoreboards, and civic projects, in terms of lost jobs, businesses and upscale residents leaving. PhDBlack if you in fact have a PHD lord help us!!!  And you think Angela Corey is doing an 'excellent job' you must be looking through Very Foggy glasses!!  And yes, if someone looks suspicious you certainly can stop and quiz them what they are doing at that time of the morning......  Vote BANE for President November 2012 You live in a a city with over 1 million people.  There are going to be murders.   Go to any midsize or major city its the same thing.  There have been people willing to kill others since the beggining of time and for a variety of reasons and there is no easy solution to it.   I think as time moves on people have less and less regard for human life. If you look at the posts on here, not to many of them seem to see this as a tragedy.   People have become more and more desinsitized to it. ----------------------- @no avail:  Boston Mass is one of the most liberal cities in American and they have cameras everywhere.   In fact I would say you tend to have that kind of stuff more in "liberal cities"  than traditionally conservative.  Thats another example of those stupid labels being overused. @MikeatBeaches may the Lord help you yes I do have an earned PhD..........and yes I do think that Angela Corey is doing an excellent job........my opinion is just different from your just move on.....no you just cannot begin to stop people because you don't like the way they look....can't do it.........peace...... We probably have more crime because the SAO office doesn't put hardened criminals in jail. She puts 12 year old abused, Innocent children and  innocent abused women in jail. BuckeyeJag I am guessing the PhD is not in English. Probably thinks Ovomit is doing an excellent job too. Where can I get some of those glasses? Many of you think we need to move closer to the ultimate police state.  If you want to live in a society where you can be stopped at any time for any reason, I suggest you move to North Korea.  Are Americans so conditioned to look to government to solve EVERY problem?  Does anyone remember the Bill of Rights and the 4th amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure?  For Pete’s sake people!  These problems are NOT solvable by becoming a police state.  We’ve made it a crime to teach children right from wrong, and then wonder why there’s so much evil.  We’ve chased God out of the public forum entirely, and again we wonder why society is so rotten.  We rugged individualist Americans living in the so-called Land of the Free have delegated responsibility for our own personal safety to government agents. Yet every court in the land has ruled that the police have NO duty to serve or protect you!  Hey America - Get your kids in church.  Buy a gun and then learn how to use it!  And stop being SHEEP. When was the last time someone in Jacksonville beat a murder charge? I cant remember one, or it has been a long time. Usually it is finding the person that did it that seems to be a problem. Since murder is a reactive crime, and not a proactive crime, pulling people over will not do any good, and will waste the city's money that they do not have fighting all of the 4th amendment violation lawsuits and civil action suit for unreasonable search and seisuzure.  How about the Sherriff actually go after all the people with active warrants in the system, instead of waiting for them to accidently luck up on some of them. no avail, its the conservatives that always get their panties in a wad over "spying". Heck, they even think that Snodden guy is a hero! How twisted is that? And yes, he need cameras on every corner. Walking/driving down a street does not mean you cant be recorded, and you should be recorded. @ Val Armorr - Spoken like a true Gestapo Agent Annie1 Kal El - murder is a reactive crime not a proactive crime???? I hope you're not in law enforcement!  I would venture a guess that compared to planned murders there are very few spur of the moment murders!
