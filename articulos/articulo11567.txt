At approximately 7:50 p.m. Thursday evening, the SFPD responded  to multiple calls of shots fired in the area of 23rd and Arkansas. Upon arrival, officers located two shooting victims on 23rd Street. Both victims were inside a vehicle when they were shot.  The two victims were transported to San Francisco General Hospital where the male victim, a man in his 20s, died from his injuries.  The female victim, also in her 20s, suffered gun shots to the arm and leg. She was expected to survive.  In the aftermath of the shooting, a large crowd gathered at the scene. Additional officers were dispatched to address the crowd and pepper spray was used by officers to disperse those gathered. The people who were pepper sprayed fled the scene. One officer was injured and transported to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
