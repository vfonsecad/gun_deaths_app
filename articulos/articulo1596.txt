Fernando Tamez, 33, was struck in the 800 block of Church Street about 11 p.m., said Sgt. Roel Guajardo of the Sheriffâs Office. Deputies responded to the scene for a deadly conduct call. Tamez died after he was transported to McAllen Medical Center, while a 26-year-old man was injured but treated at Rio Grande Regional Hospital and released, according to a report from the Sheriffâs Office. Tamez was shot in the stomach and the second victim was shot in the foot, the report said. The small passenger car used in the shooting was silver or light-colored with a sun roof, the report said. Asked whether the shooting was gang-related, Guajardo said that âwouldnât be something I can comment on at this time.â The investigation, he said, remains active. He could not say whether a single suspect is sought or if a group was behind the shooting. Tamezâs death is the third to be investigated as a homicide by the Sheriffâs Office so far this year. About 2 a.m. Jan. 1, a man died during a drive-by shooting later connected to gang activity in the 300 block of San Angelo Drive in the Little Mexico neighborhood, south of Alamo. On Sunday, the second homicide of the year took place when a man was shot in the head in what Sheriff Lupe TreviÃ±o said authorities believe was an assassination. The other drive-by shooting on Church Street was Jan. 18. One man was shot in the leg, a non-life-threatening injury. Last month, two drive-by shootings were also reported in Lopezville. On Dec. 2, the body of a man who was shot to death was found along Rodriguez Street, which intersects with Church Street. The Sheriffâs Office said it was investigating gang ties in the incident. A man was reportedly shot in the face Dec. 28 in Lopezville during another drive-by shooting believed to be gang-related. -- Jacqueline Armendariz covers law enforcement, courts and general assignments for The Monitor.
