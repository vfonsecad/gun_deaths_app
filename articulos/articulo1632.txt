1 1 LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB) -- A Radcliff man involved in a standoff with police Wednesday took his own life after he was questioned by police about a break-in.   According to a news release from Kentucky State Police, autopsy results indicate 47-year-old Michael Strand died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  Radcliff Police were in the process of investigating a burglary at an apartment complex on 630 Seminole Drive, when Strand, who lived in the complex, was mentioned as a person of interest.  The situation turned violent when police asked Strand to make a statement. When officers followed him into his apartment to get his shoes, police say Strand pulled a gun.  "At that point he produced a firearm and fired at our officers," said Radcliff Police spokesman Officer Bryce Shumate. "Our officers returned fire and retreated out of the residence and we waited for other agencies -- KSP and Vine Grove -- to back us up, before we actually made entry."  Gunshots were exchanged between Strand and Officer Terry Moore, a 2-1/2 year veteran of the Radcliff Police Department and a retired Kentucky State Trooper. During the gunfire exchange, Sgt. Jeremy Davis, a 6-1/26 year veteran of the Radcliff Police Department, was struck in the foot by one of the rounds Strand fired.  Davis received minor injuries from the round.  When backup arrived, officers entered the apartment again and found Strand dead inside.  In addition to Radcliff Police Department and KSP, units from Vine Grove Police, Hardin County EMS and the Radcliff Fire Department responded. Previous: Copyright 2013 WDRB News.
