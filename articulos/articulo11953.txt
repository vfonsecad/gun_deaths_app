The Upton County Sheriff's Office reports Kennedy, 38, was killed in the line of duty. The incident took place at 11:15 p.m. Wednesday at the Stripes Convenience Store in McCamey. Kennedy encountered a male subject and multiple shots were fired, a news release stated. Gary David Green, 50, has been charged with capital murder in the death of Kennedy, according to Sgt. Santos Carrasco Jr. with the Texas Department of Public Safety. Green suffered gunshot wounds and is in critical condition at Medical Center Hospital. There continues to be a heavy police presence at the Stripes on Highway 385 in McCamey. The Texas Rangers are on the scene and investigating the the incident. Kennedy died on the scene of the shooting last night. Between eight and 11 shots were heard during the shooting. Texas Ranger Dewayne Goll was on the scene this morning and refused comment. Kennedy worked for the Brown County Sheriffâs Office from March 6, 2006 to Dec. 31, 2009. Brown County Sheriff Bobby Grubbs said Kennedy was âa good officer.â He said Kennedy was a K-9 officer under his command. Grubbs was at a firing range training with other officers when he heard of the fatal shooting. âWe are staggered from this,â said Grubbs the retired Texas Ranger for the Midland region. âAny time it is a fellow officer it hits too close to home. We are saddened by this.â Jessica Rodriguez, 27, described Kennedy as a family man, saying he enjoyed hunting and roping with his 15-year-old son. A third-cousin of Kennedy, Rodriguez recalled one time when she was 17 years old and was arrested by Kennedy for a minor in possession. In a rage, Rodriguez said she threatened to have Kennedy removed from the family. âHe said, âIâm just doing my job,ââ Rodriguez said. Kennedy, who lived in Rankin, leaves behind a wife and his 15- and 10-year-old sons. A hard worker, Kennedy will leave a huge hole that canât be filled, Rodriguez said. âWhether we have differences, when something like this happens, the stupidity goes out the door and we all come together,â she said. âFollow Odessa American on twitterÂ @OdessaAmerican, like us on Facebook at Odessa AmericanÂ or call 432-333-7714 for the main newsroom line.
