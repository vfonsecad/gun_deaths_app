1 1 A string of shootings in Philadelphia overnight left one man dead and two others in critical condition, police said.  In the night's first shooting, a man was shot and his car allegedly stolen in Overbrook. Officers arrived at North 61st Street and West Columbia Avenue shortly after 10 p.m. to find a man shot once on his left side, police said, with the bullet traveling through his arm into his chest.  As the man was being taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, police said, he told them he had been standing outside his car at North 61st Street and Nassau Road. He and his friend were approached by four males who told them to "give up the car," he told police, then shot him and took the car.  It's unclear how the victim ended up two blocks north at North 61st Street and West Columbia Avenue.  The man was listed in critical condition at the hospital, and police are searching for the stolen car.  A few hours later, a man was shot four times in the Elmwood area of Southwest Philadelphia.  The 35-year-old man was shot around 1:12 a.m. on the 6500 block of Dicks Avenue, police said. He was taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he was listed in critical condition. The man was shot twice in the right arm, once in the left leg, and once in the buttocks, police said.  Around the same time, police said, a man was found dead in East Germantown. Police received a call around 1:15 a.m. of a person with a gun on the 5900 block of North Opal Street, Officer Tanya Little, spokeswoman for the Philadelphia Police Department said. When officers arrived on the scene, they found a man unconscious on the ground.  The man, who had been shot in the chest, was pronounced dead at Einstein Medical Center at 1:33 a.m. Police are working to identify the man, Little said, as no identification was found on him.  The identities of the other two men, in critical condition, have not been released, as police only identify homicide victims.
