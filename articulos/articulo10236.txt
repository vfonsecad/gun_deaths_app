The incident occurred about 7:46 a.m. Saturday at Glencoe Drive and Silver Lane, according to a statement issued by the Huntington Beach Police Department. That’s where an officer encountered two men who exited a vehicle and ran. The officer gave chase, and according to the statement, a confrontation ensued which resulted in a shooting. One suspect was struck by gunfire and died at the scene. The second suspect, who police sought for questioning, was still at large. The dead man’s brother spoke to CBS2′s Greg Mills. He identified his brother as Eric Marquez, 26. “They literally told him a week ago they were going to beat him up really badly or kill him,” said brother Ruben Young. “He got away from that bad lifestyle, but police were still targeting him,” Young said. Marquez lived with his brother in Orange. “We’re not the greatest dudes in the world,” said Young, “but we’re also not the type you have to use deadly force on.” The suspect who fled is described as a male Hispanic in his early 20s. He is 6-feet tall and weighs about 200 pounds with a shaved head. Police described the officer involved in the shooting as a 9-year law enforcement veteran. The officer was not injured. The statement said a handgun was recovered at the scene. Witnesses told Mills they heard the sounds of two distinct guns being fired but police did not confirm the officer was in a shootout.
