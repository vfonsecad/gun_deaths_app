A homeowner and a female were leaving the house in the 900 block of East 178th Street when they were approached by two masked men, one with a handgun and the other with a crowbar. As the victims were getting into their vehicle, one of the men hit the homeowner in the head with the handgun and tried to pull him out. The homeowner, who has as concealed carry permit, managed to get a gun from inside the vehicle and fired multiple times, hitting the suspect in the torso. The suspect fired a shot but missed.
