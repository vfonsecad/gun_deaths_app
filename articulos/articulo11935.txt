Officers were called to the Lighthouse at Twin Lakes Apartments in the 3900 block of Lighthouse Way around 2 a.m. The 911 caller told the dispatcher that he or she could hear a woman screaming "Get off of me!" outside. A witness also described hearing what he thought was the woman being struck. Once at the scene, one of the two responding patrol officers scaled two fences and jumped a drainage ditch to get to a bleeding female victim, police said. As he approached, the male suspect ran. The officer pursued for about a quarter mile and made multiple commands for the suspect to stop, police said. The officer opened fire when the suspect reached into a dark bag, News4's Erika Gonzalez reported. Police did not say how many shots were fired. It's unclear what the suspect may have been reaching for, but no weapon was found at the scene. Police say the officer involved is a seven-year veteran of the force. He is on routine administration leave during the investigation. The victim was treated at the scene and is talking to police.
