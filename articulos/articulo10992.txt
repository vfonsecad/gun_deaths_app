1 1 NEAR THE DALLES, Ore. – A suspect hopped out of a car and opened fire on a state trooper during a traffic stop east of The Dalles on Thursday afternoon. The trooper had pulled the vehicle over along I-84 about 20 miles east of The Dalles. According to Lt. Gregg Hastings, the suspect then opened fire on the trooper, hitting him in the side. The trooper’s injury was minor and he is expected to recover. He was able to return fire and hit the suspect before calling for help, Hastings said. Despite being hit, the suspect managed to drive away. Other troopers found him slumped over the wheel of his car about a half mile down the highway. The troopers tried to give him medical attention but he was already dead. The suspect, who has not yet been identified, had three kids in the car with him. Hastings didn’t have their exact age, but said they were “probably over 10 years of age.” Their relationship with the suspect is not clear. They were taken to The Dalles to be interviewed. Hastings also did not give out the trooper’s name, but did say he is 26 years old. The trooper was taken to Mid-Columbia Medical Center for treatment. He was expected to be released from the hospital Thursday night. According to Hastings, the trooper was working overtime when the incident happened. He has worked for OSP for five years.  I-84 was shut down at Biggs Junction from milepost 105 to milepost 109 for the investigation. All lanes were reopened by 7 p.m. Traffic leading up to the closure and on detour routes was very congested, according to a reporter on the scene.  Glad the Trooper killed the scumbag. Too bad it wasn't a headshot caught on film.  Police Dash cam video here shows man got out of car, didn't listen to orders, pulled gun and shot at officer first.ÃÂ  http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/10/04/shots-fired-shots-fired-heart-stopping-video-shows-highway-shootout-after-man-pulled-over-for-speeding-with-his-kids-in-the-car/  Met this man through my sister. She and he became acquainted through tagged.com account. I Swear he told us Oregon had kidnapped his kids once before!. OMG I just found out he's dead last night! Mr. Allen informed my sister and I that Oregon had wrongfully seized custody of his kids and had sent them to an abusive mother, and he was in process of getting them back. NO LIE! I am kind of fearful for I am looking at same scenario with my children.  He was a good man...a military vet, and a pastor, and gun permit having law abiding citizen...did yall ever wonder Y there is very little details about this situation??? A MAJOR COVER UP IS TAKING PLACE...Y dont yall ask y doesnt it say what kind of traffic stop was taking place? and further more the kids who are witnesses said the officer shot at their dad hit him and he returned fire and got in the car to get them to safety...NOT INCLUDED IN THE REPORT...Stop jumping on the band wagon praising the death over someone...im deeply sadden by how yall are responding...His kids was in the CAR!!!!  Looks like everyone got into it !ÃÂ ÃÂ  YEEEEHAAA Responding agencies to this incident included OSP, Sherman County Sheriff's Office, Wasco County Sheriff's Office, Klickitat County, Washington Sheriff's Office, Gilliam County Sheriff's Office, Hood River County Sheriff's Office, The Dalles Police Department, Hood River Police Department, Hermiston Police Department, Sherman County District Attorney's Office and Oregon Department of Transportation.   It took me over two hours to get home that day. Not because of the shooting. Because I stopped at Stanford's on the way home. With some artichoke dip and happy hour Coronas, time sure does fly.  Now that's what I call gun control.  All the people with the negative comments really crack me up. You don't know what happened or the mindset he was in before you make judgements.  I feel for the officers family but at the same time I had to rock my wife to sleep over this and you don't know the pain of his family.  This is the only Death Penalty I approve of. ÃÂ No question of an innocent man being put to death.  whats ÃÂ up trippel nipple   Glad that Trooper is fine and too bad that three children had to see all of this with their father died in front of the children.ÃÂ  Hope the children will be okay  Duly served by Glock .40 caliber.ÃÂ  No trial, no jury no prison.ÃÂ  Taxpayer saved.  It took my son 3 hours to get home from Arlington tonight because they had blocked off the west bound traffic as well as the east boundÃÂ  traffic.ÃÂ  I would have thought blocking off only the east bound would have been sufficient since it was separated from the oncoming traffic with a guardrail. I'm glad to hear the officer is doing good and think about those poor children.ÃÂ  I'm sure it was probably their dad who got shot too.  Don't shoot people.    I'm glad the Trooper is doing fine.  All I can think of is the children in the car....   That young trooper did exactly what he needed to do and was trained to do.ÃÂ  Job well done, sir!  It appears that the folks in the vehicle was his family and that he shot himself after being wounded by the trooper. Possibly black and ex military. Just rumors, can't say where they came from. A sad ending for all involved.  Prayers for the little kids and the trooper who will have to deal with this for the rest of their life .... Good news is we as tax payers will not have to pay to support this low life p.o.s.   Justice Served....... 'Nuf said......  Nice shooting trooper. You hit the intended target, the kids are safe and you get to go home at the end of the day. That is a successful shift. I hope that kids can deal with this and the trooper realizes that he did what he had to do. There was no other option. The dead guy was in charge and you responded appropriately.  "Man shoots trooper during traffic stop, trooper returns fire and kills suspect" Hooray for the good guys!   So glad the officer was able to take control pf the situation, and the children weren't hurt. Poor kids.   Is that a viper?ÃÂ  Corvette?ÃÂ ÃÂ  Poor photo.    The wounded trooper appears to have killed the suspect. The trooper was shot while getting out of his vehicle after initiating a traffic stop, he returned fire, the suspect fled, and was found DEAD about a mile away. The trooper suffered a minor wound to his thigh. GOOD JOB OSP.  @friend of deceased  kind of looks like the video disproved everything you said  @friend of deceased Yeah, friends and family shouldn't ever bother reading the comments.ÃÂ  More often than not, they're very hurtful and mean.ÃÂ  The trolls like to hide out with their anonymous screen names and hidden identities and cause havoc.ÃÂ  Other people tend to make jokes to make light of a serious or dangerous situation (just a way to cope -- I know I'm guilty of that at times).ÃÂ  Its how we come to terms in understanding how something so seemingly impossible has happened. While I can certainly agree we don't know all of the details, neither do you.ÃÂ  And I doubt you will ever know the "facts" because there are only three sides -- the officer's position, Mr. Van Allen's, and the truth.ÃÂ  Each had their own personal opinion about the situation (which may have even included thinking they were in harms way or doing something right). I'll tell you this, though, I would never pull a gun (loaded or otherwise) on a law enforcement official.ÃÂ  There are other solutions to end a situation and that is probably one of the worst to pick (of course, there's always hindsight so I'm not blaming either man).ÃÂ  I would like to hear the officer's side of the argument and why he chose to use his weapon (and did he know with absolute certainty that there were even children -- ok "minors" -- in the car and how did that factor in to his decision to fire back). At this point there is no report.ÃÂ  It is still up to review, modification, and speculation on both sides of the situation.ÃÂ  And, as a friend, you need to keep an open mind.ÃÂ  Although this man was a good friend and father in your opinion, he may have been experiencing demons (or, even, something like a brain tumor) that dramatically changed his behavior and turned him in to a very dangerous man. It is best to stay away from the message boards and make sure any comments you make in the social media are done so with the highest security.ÃÂ  You don't want the comments you make turn into something that can be used against you or your friend or, even, against the children.ÃÂ  And, please, someone make sure those kids aren't reading this crap.ÃÂ  Regroup, focus your energy on healing those who need it the most (which might include you) and be open to understand the circumstances and be able to use that information in a helpful, constructive way. Sadly, the biggest losers in this whole mess are the innocent children.  @friend of deceasedÃÂ Trolls are fun, even more when high on drugs or drink.   @UselessOpinionÃÂ That is funny!  @UselessOpinionÃÂ  Did you make a "gay" jokes? or were you looking "Queer"?..You could have gotten loaded both in your stomach AND wallet!  @UselessOpinionÃÂ  Now, that is what I would call a useless opinion.  so was it bloody when you rocked your wife... is this a murder that your confessing???ÃÂ  do you need a wood chipper??? what about his pain... not just his family... I'm sure it's a mind screw just shooting some one... plus getting hit by a bullet... so now that your wife has been rocked... does this mean she is stoned??? are you going to remarrie??? ÃÂ inquiring minds want to know....  @twanoneÃÂ Why would you have to rock your wife to sleep over this?If she is that weak, maybe you should keep her away from TV.  @twanone Everyone here belongs to the Player Haters Club and are Junior Detectives.ÃÂ ÃÂ   it didn't really say it was his father... he could have been a kid knapper  @Mr Spooky YEP!!  @momo Read under 18.ÃÂ  So far we do not know the age of the shooter.ÃÂ  He may have been only 18.  @RalphCramdenÃÂ Oh, you and your rumors!  @RalphCramdenÃÂ  Yea, it sounds like this was the best possible outcome for the situation. I feel bad for the kids. You know the trooper feels bad for them having to experience all of that.  @Ashley EmilyÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  Electric cars are cool    @Anton LaVeyÃÂ Porsche? BMW? There were 3 kids in the car around 10 years old.  @CTWUÃÂ @friend of deceasedÃÂ  shut up FOD. Save your dumbass conspiracy bs......I watched the video too. Suspect fired first, he got what he deserved. Goodbye POS scumbag.  @Tonnie ThompsonÃÂ @UselessOpinion And then drove home impaired.......  @BamaReb2ÃÂ Bama? He's from Missouri...Nuff said :)ÃÂ   @twanoneÃÂ That is Chief Junior Detective to you.  @StudleyÃÂ  he was just the BIC for the day (Babysitter in Charge)  @tripple nippleÃÂ @GorgegirlÃÂ  Milk, milk, lemonade. Round the corner fudge is made.  @tripple nippleÃÂ @mmeiko264ÃÂ I think it was 50, 1 tear olds in a VW bus with 3 chickens and a racoon.  @Anton LaVeyÃÂ ÃÂ  Remember that if you ever need help.   @tripple nippleÃÂ @mmeiko264ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  Wait.......a ........minute.....Was that a clown car?ÃÂ ÃÂ  And, the guy shot the cop with one of those guns that drop a sign that says; "BANG!".ÃÂ   Yeah, I get it typical over reaction by the cop.
