The shooting happened at a home on the 1500 block of Lodi Avenue about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday. The resident, a 24-year-old man, was found at the scene suffering from a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. Investigators determined that the man and three other people were home when three assailants tried a home-invasion robbery, said San Mateo Deputy Police Chief Mike Callagy. Early Thursday, all three suspects showed up at Regional Medical Center in San Jose with gunshot wounds. One, 23-year-old Bryant Ma of San Jose, died at the hospital, and another was recovering, police said. The surviving suspects face arrest, Callagy said. The names of the victims and suspects weren't released. The home invasion did not appear to be random, authorities said. "The suspects specifically targeted this house for reasons that are not entirely clear at this time," Callagy said. Henry K. Lee is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
