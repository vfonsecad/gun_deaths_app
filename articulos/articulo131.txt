1 By Maurielle LueFox 2 NewsDETROIT (WJBK) -- Andre Perry's family is speaking out for the first time.  The story of the 28-year-old's murder is unbelievable.  On January 14, he was shot in the back and head five times while he was changing a tire.  The AAA tow truck driver was still on the scene."They haven't gotten the person.  That couldn't be hard.  The tow truck driver was there.  Somebody saw something," says his grandmother, August Germany.According to the family, police believe Andre knew his killer.  Phone and text records were traced to an acquaintance, who works near the crime scene and drives a blue Audi.Germany says if police know all this, why is her grandson's killer still roaming free?"I'm just so hurt that I'll never see my grandson again.  People need to help us get him because we need justice for him."Andre loved being with his family.  An overworked people pleaser is how they describe him.  He was laid to rest Tuesday.  His 13-month-old son is too young to understand. "Seeing my nephew like reach in his casket, reach his arms out and grab him," says sister Amber Duckett. "Another black boy [is] going to grow up without a father," says Germany.Police confirm they are investigating, but don't want to ruin their case with speculation.Andre's family understands these things take time, but want police to make the arrest before the killer skips town.
