1 March 15, 2014 UPDATE 1/13/13 at 6:19 p.m.KANAWHA COUNTY, W.Va. (WSAZ) -- A man was killed in a shootout with deputies. Lawrence "Pete" Vaughan lived with his mother, Carol in the 6100-block of Quick Road in Pinch. Deputies got a call Saturday night that he was beating his mother. When deputies arrived, they say Vaughan was running through the home, then opened the door and using a pistol immediately started firing. Deputies took the suspect down. "Some people you're related by blood -- some people you're related by love," said Julia Stricker, a close family friend of Carol Vaughan. "She said that she just heard the gunfire and she passed out so she didn't remember a whole lot of what had happened -- and she said she woke up with one of the policeman holding her hand,â said Stricker. With reminders at every step, deputies say Pete Vaughan was beating his mother and when they arrived he was scrambling inside the house.  Vaughan then opened the door, deputies said, and without saying a word opened fire. Stricker said the sadness and pain of the incident wonât soon go away. "It was very emotional for me -- to walk on that front porch and see what I seen,â said Stricker. The same feelings are felt by Sarah Mollohan who lives next door to the Vaughanâs with her husband and three little girls. ."Kind of out of character -- we got kind of scared with the babies and it being that close,â said neighbor Sarah Mollohan. The real shock for Mollohan and Stricker, they say, is that something so dire and wretched could come out of what they call a good family. "Pete -- he was a nice person to know, but it's not like his character to go off like that,â said Mollohan. "Consider them family -- and this is just such a tragedy, it's such a tragedy that things have escalated to this,â said Stricker. Gunfire erupting and ending with many wondering what caused Pete Vaughan to spiral out of control. No deputies were hurt in the incident.  Family members told investigators Vaughan had been violent with his mother in the past. Keep clicking on WSAZ.com for the latest information.

When deputies went to investigate, they say Vaughan was seen running through the home, then opened the door and immediately started firing at them using a pistol -- no words exchanged.  "They saw the subject inside, who seemed rather agitated," Kanawha County Sheriff John Rutherford said. "As they were on the front porch, the subject exited the house through the front door and started firing at the deputies, who took tactical positions and returned fire."      Deputies say Vaughan was killed on the spot.    Neighbor Troy Hawkins says he heard the gunfire while working on his computer near the front door. He didn't suspect anything was wrong until he came outside and saw the police cruisers, because he says hearing gunfire is a common occurrence on Quick Road.  "There are a lot of hunters and people target practicing, so it's not anything new," he said.           Police say the investigation is just beginning.
