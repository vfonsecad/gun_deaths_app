Chief Deputy Kenny Davenport said deputies found Mark Curran Neff, 58, dead outside his home along Coleman Road around 7:18 p.m. Saturday after responding to a reported shooting. Davenport said Neff leased some property in the area for hunting. In the past he had butted heads with the a homeowner over exactly where the boundary of the lease ended.  The two men got into an argument Saturday night again over the property, and it escalated. Authorities found shell casings from three firearms at the scene and confiscated the weapons believed to have been used in the fire fight.  Davenport said the homeowner was claiming self defense in the shooting.  Investigators were waiting the results of an autopsy and evidence sent to be tested in the case Monday, Davenport said.  Coleman Road, a narrow stretch of mud and dirt about seven miles off River Road near the Neches River, is usually only accessible with a four-wheel drive vehicle or an ATV, according to the sheriff's office.
