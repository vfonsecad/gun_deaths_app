"She was gentle, kind, full of the aloha spirit, the epitome of the aloha spirit and everything it stands for," said Victoria Kaiulani Visiko, Edline's friend. To Visiko, Edline Chun, known to her family as "Auntie Eddie," was a kindred spirit. Visiko said, "When someone is full of the aloha spirit, that person is the most incredible person you want to know in every way." She says she met 73-year old victim more than ten years ago when Chun took classes at Visiko's Hawaiian performing arts studio. "She actually almost became a mentor to me because of her upbringing," said Visiko. She says Chun was born in Hawaii and has no family locally. She was divorced and the only child of parents who have passed away.  "Well she had us," said Visiko.  "We became her Hawaiian family." On Wednesday, maintenance workers found Chun's body at Tryon Park. Police believe she was shot and killed during a robbery. "To imagine her first of all in that predicament that someone was taking from her first and foremost and then all of a sudden taking her life too and then Auntie Eddie ending up in a ditch by herself," said Victoria.  "I don't know if she was hurting for a long time. It's just unbelievable. It's a concept I can't grasp on to. " Police took a "person of interest" into custody but have not charged anyone. "I don't think you know what I'd like to see done but I want justice and I will be there every step of the way," said Visiko. Chun also taught at RIT as an adjunct professor. Victoria says she was very involved in her community. "The light that she had was so bright," Visiko said. A light that she's determined to keep shining. "I love her so much and that will go on forever, make aloha," said Visiko.Victoria says she's now searching for Chun's Hawaiian relatives. She hopes to plan a memorial event for her in the near future. We're hoping to learn more details from Rochester Police on this case on Monday.
