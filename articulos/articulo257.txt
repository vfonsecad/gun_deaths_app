1  HILLTOWN, Pa. - February 27, 2013 (WPVI) --  Investigators are asking for the public's help in their search for a vehicle thought to be involved in the murder of Hilltown resident Joseph Canazaro last month.	    PHOTOS: WEBSITE and iPAD | WIRELESS        48-year-old Joseph Canazaro was killed on January 18, 2013 inside his rental home on the unit block of Swartley Road in Hilltown Township - a home he shared with his live-in girlfriend and his two children.   It was 6:30 a.m. when two men broke through a first-floor window and entered brandishing handguns. Canazaro's 15-year-old son had already left for school, but his girlfriend and his 12-year-old son were still at home.  They were tied up but later managed to escape.   Canazaro was shot and killed during the home invasion. The killers took several guns from Canazaro's collection before fleeing in his Lincoln pickup truck.   The pickup truck was found dumped behind the Giant Super Market, located at 1465 West Broad Street in Quakertown.   In the surveillance video released Wednesday, at approximately 10:00 a.m. on the day of the murder, the red Nissan in question can be seen pulling up to Canazaro's vehicle. The pickup then backs up in the parking lot to another parking spot further away from the building, and the Nissan follows. After some time the Nissan pulls out of the parking spot, leaving the pickup where it was later discovered by police.   Canazaro was the co-owner of an Ambler tavern, along with other business interests.  Sources confirm police think he may have been targeted and are looking into his financial history, including a bankruptcy declaration several years ago.   Those sources said that bankruptcy declaration came three days after he bounced two large checks at a Philadelphia check cashing agency, one worth $150,000 and another worth $60,000.   One of the suspects is described as a Hispanic male standing about 5'9" tall.  The other suspect is described as a "smaller" Asian male wearing a black jacket and cargo pants.  Police said both suspects were wearing masks.   Authorities have set up two tip lines in this case.  Anyone with information is asked to call 267-517-9119 or 215-453-6011.   Get more Local/State Â»
