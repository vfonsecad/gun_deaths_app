SAN DIEGO  A Madison High School wrestling coach was arrested Tuesday after a 45-year-old man was fatally shot at a home on Denver Street in San Diegoâs Bay Park neighborhood. Police received several 911 calls about 2:35 p.m. from Denver Street residents reporting the shooting. One caller said his roommate had been shot, and another said a woman had run from a home, screaming about blood, police Officer Ed Zwibel said. Officers found the wounded man dead in the backyard of the home, homicide Lt. Mike Hastings said. He said the man had been shot at least once in the upper torso.

He was later arrested on suspicion of murder, Hastings said.  One of his neighbors, Jake Schmidt, 20, a Cuyamaca College student, said he knows Needham, his wife and teenage son. Schmidt said a police helicopter broadcast repeated orders for Needham to come out of the house.  He came outside about 6 p.m. with his hands up. He walked backward toward officers, who swiftly handcuffed him, put him in a patrol car and took him to police headquarters. Hastings said family members had called Needham on his phone and persuaded him to come out of the house. The lieutenant said there had been some kind of altercation at the Denver Street house about an hour before the shooting.  Schmidt said that Needham has lived across the street from his family for 15 years. âI always thought that he was a nice guy,â Schmidt said. âHeâs a big sports fan.â A Madison High website lists Needham as the wrestling teamâs varsity coach for 2012-2013. Police investigators went to the Clairemont school during the afternoon. Other websites show that Needham was head wrestling coach at University City High School in 2006 and 2007, and was involved in North City Youth Baseball in 2009. Another longtime neighbor of Needhamâs, Josh Moore, 25, described him as kind, âa really good guyâ who would go out of his way to help someone. He also called him a very good father. A woman returned Tuesday night to the Denver Street home with a police officer to retrieve a dog from the cordoned-off home. Friends of the victim said she was his live-in girlfriend. She said she did not want to make a statement. Officials had not released the victimâs name, pending notification of his family. Be relevant, respectful, honest, discreet and responsible.
