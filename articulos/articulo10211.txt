The (Hilton Head) Island PacketAugust  3, 2013                                                          HILTON HEAD, SC —  An 85-year-old Sun City Hilton Head man is dead and his wife hospitalized with gunshot wounds following an incident Friday afternoon at their home, according to the Beaufort County Sheriff’s Office. According to a press release issued late Friday night, deputies did a health and welfare check at a home at 108 General Hardee Way in Sun City at about 3 p.m. They found the body of Robert Jacobsen and his wounded wife, whom the press release did not identify. The woman was taken to Coastal Carolina Hospital in Hardeeville for treatment before being transferred to Memorial Medical University Hospital in Savannah, the release said. The handgun believed used in the incident was recovered near his body. Preliminary findings indicate Jacobsen’s wound was self inflicted, the release said. An autopsy is scheduled for Saturday at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.
