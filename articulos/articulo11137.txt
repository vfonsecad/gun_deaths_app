Okanogan County officials responded to an alleged shooting victim on Cow Camp Road on Pontiac Ridge out of Chesaw Monday afternoon. Deputies said that when they arrived they found one person who looked to have been shot. That person was pronounced dead at the scene by officials.  Officials said two people were grouse hunting in the area of Cow Camp Road on Pontiac Ridge out of Chesaw on Monday. One hunter got out of a vehicle to shoot a grouse and the man's hunting partner said he heard a shot and saw his partner fall to the ground with blood on him.  The victim's partner said he drove from the scene to a home in the area to call police.  Rogers says the hunting partner is currently not a suspect, and no suspects have been identified. But investigators do have "people of interest" they'd like to interview.
