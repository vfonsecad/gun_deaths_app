1   By Bob Mims  The Salt Lake Tribune      A man and woman whose bodies were found in the smoldering remains of a southeast Salt Lake County home last week were shot to death by an unknown third party, investigators say.  Unified Police Lt. Justin Hoyal said efforts continued Monday to identify the remains, which were burned beyond recognition. "We believe that these two victims have been killed at the hands of another. The victims were killed as a result of injuries sustained from a shooting," Hoyal said. Investigators suspect the fire may have been set by the killer in an effort to destroy evidence. Firefighters rushed to the scene of a house fire at 2811 E. Ksel Drive (9457 South) at 8:25 a.m. Friday. When crews made entry, they found the bodies in the master bedroom. "This fire is suspicious as the burn patterns are not consistent with an accidental fire," Hoyal said, noting that UPD detectives are working the case in conjunction with Unified Fire Authority and Sandy Fire Department arson investigators.  Hoyal said "a lot of possible suspects" have arisen in the case so far, but no arrests have been made. Authorities are asking anyone with information that may be helpful to detectives to contact UPD at 801-743-5915.  remims@sltrib.com
