The Fayette County coroner says Derek S. Pelphrey, 23, died from a gunshot wound. Police say Pelphrey was shot while sitting in his car on Ridgepoint Run Road near Spangler Drive, off Wilson Downing Road, just before 9 p.m. The incident was originally reported as a pedestrian hit by a car. Officers say Pelphrey pulled himself out of the car onto the road after he was shot in the neck. EMS took him to UK Hospital where he was pronounced dead a short time later. Investigators say the car window was open, and they don't think anybody else was in the vehicle with Pelphrey. "It's odd but it is a dark location. There were no houses facing the scene, so we are still canvassing the neighborhood. At this time, nobody has said that they have heard anything. That's not to say they won't come forward at a later time," a police spokesperson said.   15 minutes ago FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) - The rampage at Fort Hood that left three dead and 16 wounded last week was related to...
