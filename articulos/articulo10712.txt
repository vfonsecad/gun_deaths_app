Darius Oliver, 21, was shot in the head just before 6 p.m. Monday in the drive-by shooting and was initially thought by police to have died. He was pronounced dead at 12:55 a.m. Friday at Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, where he had been on life support, according to the Chicago Tribune. DNAinfo Chicago previously reported that Oliver, the youngest victim in the Monday shooting outside Uptown Baptist Church at Wilson and Sheridan, was brain dead and he was not expected to recover. Oliver's girlfriend, Brianna Williams, told ABC Chicago her boyfriend "had just went to his first day of work of his new job that day" prior to the shooting. She told DNAinfo he had just moved to Chicago from California a couple months earlier to reconnect with his mother. Though police describe the shooting as "very clearly" gang-related, Williams told CBS Chicago at a Wednesday prayer vigil for the shooting victims that her boyfriend was not a gang member. No charges have been filed by police in the shooting, though three persons of interest are reportedly in custody while an investigation continues.
