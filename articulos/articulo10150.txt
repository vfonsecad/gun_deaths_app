Kyevon Daites Frazzell Gayles, 35, had been transported to WakeMed after the shooting outside the Westchester Apartments across Seventh Avenue from the police station. He spent the next several days in critical condition. Investigators continue to follow up leads as they pursue a suspect, according to police spokesman Chris Clayton. A six-foot-tall black male with an average build and dark complexion was seen leaving the area immediately after the shooting. The shooter, thought to be in his 30s, wore a white ball cap with a black brim, white T-shirt, black shorts and goatee. The suspect was seen getting into a white, newer-model, four-door Nissan near the apartments. Clayton said police think the model was 2008 or newer. Gayles had an address in the adjoining Forrest Hills Apartments.  Gayles died on Monday. Police released word of Gayles death Thursday morning.
