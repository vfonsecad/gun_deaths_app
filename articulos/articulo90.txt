1 (Photo Credit: KDKA)  PITTSBURGH (KDKA) â Police are investigating an overnight shooting in East Liberty that left one person dead. It happened just before midnight Sunday at the intersection of North Negley Avenue and Rippey Street, outside of an apartment complex. Police stayed on the scene until after 3 a.m., but have yet to release much information. The victim was 37-year-old Lou Auer of East Liberty.Â He was found with a gunshot wound to the torso and pronounced dead at the scene. One neighbor who did not want to be identified said she heard three gunshots. “It’s not [abnormal] to hear the gunshots, but to see a body outside your building, that’s (abnormal),” she said. So far there have been no arrests and police have yet to determine a motive, but say that two black males were seen running after shots were fired. “With the body laying there, and then for the kids to get up this morning and still see the sheet still left there,” the neighbor said. “It’s just mind boggling. And my daughter asked, ‘why’s that out there?’” A maintenance worker at the apartment building said he had to chase the victim out of the building twice, but did not elaborate on why. Anyone with information is asked to call the Pittsburgh Homicide Squad at 412-323-7161.
