Officers responded to a report of a gunshot victim at 9:26 p.m. Monday in the 300 block of South Dixie Boulevard. Instead officers reportedly found two gunshot victims inside of a vehicle: 50-year-old Venesta Davis, who died at the scene, and Davisâ son Andrew Darius Thurman, 20. Thurman remained in critical condition Christmas Day at Medical Center Hospital. The suspect is L.C. Davis Jr., 55, who should be considered armed and dangerous, according to a statement signed by Sgt. Darryl Smith, a homicide detective. Police have warrants for L.C. Davis Jr., which charge him with murder and aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. Thurman is not his son. The investigation so far suggests L.C. Davis Jr. shot his ex-wife while the unspecified vehicle she and her son were driving in was moving, said Cpl. Sherrie Carruth, police spokeswoman, in an email. Then, police believe, the suspect ran up to Thurman and shot him. Police did not immediately explain L.C. Davis Jr.'s physical position, relative to those of the victims, during the shooting. L.C. Davis Jr. was last seen driving a Pewter or Tan 2008 Chevrolet Avalanche, according to the release. The truckâs license plate number is BM83120. Police did not publicly discuss a possible motive for the slaying. Public driverâs license records list the suspect and the two victims as living in the 200 block of Patterson Avenue, but it was unclear Tuesday whether that information was current.
