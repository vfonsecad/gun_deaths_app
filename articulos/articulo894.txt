GUERRA                                                     TURLOCK — A 35-year-old man was shot to death in Turlock on Saturday night, authorities said. Hours later, a traffic stop led to the arrest of a 20-year-old suspect wanted in connection with the homicide. On Saturday, officers were called to the 800 block of South Avenue at 9:15 p.m. on a report of shots fired, according to Lt. Nino Amirfar of the Turlock Police Department. When they arrived, they found David Hernandez suffering from gunshot wounds. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he later died. On Sunday, Ernesto Negrete of Turlock was taken into custody after a traffic stop in the 1200 block of North Olive Avenue, according to Officer Mayra Lewis. He was booked into Stanislaus County Jail on charges of murder and methamphetamine possession. Details of the arrest, including the time and nature of the traffic stop, were not released. Amirfar said there's a possibility the shooting may be gang-related. Anyone with any information regarding this incident is asked to contact Detective Frank Navarro at 668-5550 ext. 6619.
