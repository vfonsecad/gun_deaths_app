One of two suspects in the theft of several items from a Bryant police vehicle was found dead Monday night in what police believe to be a suicide. Nia Bullard, 21, of Bryant and another individual broke into a Bryant Police Department patrol vehicle around 10 p.m. and stole items from inside the car, including a police-issued gun, raid vest and Taser, according to a news release from the department.  While investigating the break-in that night, authorities also received a call of a person being shot inside a camper off Springhill Road. When officers arrived, police found one person with a gunshot wound to their head laying next to the officer's stolen gun, the release states. Officers determined the deceased person, whose name was not released, was involved in the vehicle break-in after they found the other stolen items inside the camper, according to the release. State Police said they believe the gunshot wound was self-inflicted and foul play wasn't involved. Further investigation led authorities to Bullard, who later admitted her involvement in the theft and helped police recover more of the stolen items. Police said Bullard is charged with theft of property, breaking and entering, hindering apprehension and tampering with evidence.
