1 1 April 7, 2014 August 14, 2013 UPDATED 5:38 PM Fluvanna County hasn't had a homicide investigation in four years.  That changed Wednesday morning, when law enforcement found a man dead in his front yard on Gravel Hill Road. Forty-one-year-old Jerry Palmer was found with one gunshot to the head. Nearby, 28-year-old Crystal Trent was shot twice, but still alive. She was taken by helicopter to UVa Medical Center, where it has been reported that she is in critical condition. Investigators believe the shooting was an attempted murder-suicide, but are not ready to confirm that. "That's our working theory at this point in time," says Lt. David Wells of the Fluvanna County Sheriff's Office. "I don't really want to call it an official anything until I get the word from the medical examinerâs office." Yvonne Stanton, a neighbor on Gravel Hill Road, called 911 about the incident. She says she called because she knew immediately there was something wrong at the house as she drove by this morning.  Stanton says she looked over at the porch and saw a woman sitting and bleeding and as she got a closer look, she saw the man. Stanton took care of Trent's three-year-old boy, who was taken out of the home by police. Officials say the boy was unharmed and in good health. Investigators say there are still lots of questions about who exactly shot who, and when. _________________________________________________One man is dead and a woman is in critical condition after a shooting on Gravel Hill Road, near Route 6.
