1 Police are seeking the shooter who fired  17 times, resulting in his target’s failed  weeklong struggle to survive.   Share this Story: Photo by Philadelphia Police Department With his child by his side, a West Passyunk man was shot multiple times, including a few to his head that caused serious brain damage, in a Girard Estate parking lot two days before Christmas. He succumbed to his injuries Sunday.  Louis Porter, 45, of the 1900 block of South Bonsall Street, parked his black 2001 Cadillac DTS in the parking lot at Walgreens, 2310 Oregon Ave., at 8:16 p.m. Dec. 23, multiple police sources said. As he and his 5-year-old son walked from the car, an unknown man pulled up in a dark gray Ford sedan, exited the driver’s side, pulled out a gun and started shooting. The target backed away and tried to retreat into his auto, but the gunman kept shooting, firing a total of 17 shots, before backing out of the parking lot in his vehicle and heading in an unknown direction.    While the child was unharmed, his father received a gunshot wound to his left wrist, two to his left arm and several more to his head, which caused severe brain injuries, police said. A medic transported him to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania where he remained in critical condition for a week. He was pronounced dead at 11:15 a.m. Sunday.  Police recovered ballistic evidence, as well as the victim’s car and cell phone at the scene, authorities said. The motive was unknown at press time.    The gunman was described as black, 5-foot-10 to 6-foot-2, 220 pounds and wearing a black jacket, gray hoodie and dark-colored jeans. It is believed there was another man in the passenger’s seat of the offender’s auto, but a detailed description of him was not available at press time. The vehicle was described as a dark gray Ford sedan, possibly a Taurus or Fusion with a partial tag of FSH456.  To report information, call Homicide Division at 215-686-3334, text PPDTIP (773847) or visit phillypolice.com/forms.

One, the police have no clue where the culprit is an asking for the public's assistance, even with the above photo and video. Two is a tricky one, I can't figure it out...Oh quick note, CSI is just a tv show, in real life murderers gets away easily.Following the above issue, REAL EASY.” TheDude said...
