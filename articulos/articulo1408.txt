1 Pittsburgh police are investigating after a teenager from the Allentown neighborhood was shot to death there last night. Homicide detectives believe that 16-year-old Deondre Pace was walking out of a nearby convenience store toward his home when he was confronted by at least two males near the intersection of Climax Street and Beltzhoover Avenue about 7:15 p.m., according to news release from Major Crimes Lt. Kevin Kraus. Police said one male pulled out a handgun and fired multiple shots at the teen from a close distance at the intersection. Zone 3 officers responded to a 911 call about that time and found Mr. Pace on the ground, unresponsive with a gunshot wound to the chest. He was shot at least twice in the chest, Major Crimes Lt. Dan Herrmann said Thursday night. Both males fled after the shooting. Deondre was taken to UPMC Mercy, where he died at 8:14 p.m., according to the Allegheny County medical examiner's office. Pittsburgh Public Schools spokeswoman Ebony Pugh confirmed Deondre was a sophomore at Pittsburgh Brashear High School in Beechview. "We are sad to report the death of Pittsburgh Brashear 10th grader Deondre Pace," she said in a statement. "Deondre is described as an honor roll student focused on learning. Deondre will be missed by all who knew him." Police are looking for two black males, but have no suspects or a motive at this time. Anyone with information is asked to call the city's homicide squad at 412-323-7161. Molly Born: mborn@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1944.
