Original post at 6 a.m.: Two men turned up shot, one fatally, at a Stemmons Corridor gas station after a shooting late Tuesday in northwest Dallas. The survivor pulled into a Tetco gas station at Mockingbird Lane and State Highway 183 about 10:15 p.m. driving a Chevy Malibu full of bullet holes, according to a police report. The driver, a 23-year-old Dallas man, was shot in the leg, but his passenger, a 22-year-old Tyler man, was much worse off. He had been shot multiple times in the head and upper body and was pronounced dead at the scene, the report says. The driver, who was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital with a gunshot wound to the left knee, told police they had been shot while driving. The police report lists the shooting location in the 10900 block of Goodnight Lane, about five miles north on a fairly desolate stretch of road off Walnut Hill Lane and Stemmons. No word yet on a motive for the shooting, which is under investigation. Follow me and the rest of our breaking news staff on Twitter @tweeterson or @dallasnews.
