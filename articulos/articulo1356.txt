But on Wednesday morning, for some unknown reason, she went to the home of Linda Sue Davis three doors away. Davis, whom her family said suffered from mental illness, shot and killed the 75-year-old Shamburg, then went outside and waved her gun around, police say.              Within minutes, a Broward Sheriff<e2><80><99>s deputy shot and killed Davis, 60, when she refused to drop her handgun. The deputy found Shamburg face-down in the driveway of Davis<e2><80><99> home at 4714 NW 44th St. in Tamarac. Shamburg lived at 4721 NW 44th Street, three houses west. Shamburg was shot inside Davis<e2><80><99> home shortly after 10:35 a.m., and she staggered outside to the driveway before collapsing, BSO officials said. BSO homicide detectives have not revealed a motive for Davis to shoot Shamburg, but Sheriff Scott Israel, who was on the scene Wednesday, told reporters that the women may have been involved in a dispute. Family members of Davis said she suffered from a mental condition, and that she took <e2><80><9c>heavy medication.<e2><80><99><e2><80><99> Andrew Davis, 70, said his sister suffered a nervous breakdown some time ago, and that BSO deputies were familiar with her condition. <e2><80><9c>Police have come here, restrained her, and taken her to the hospital before,<e2><80><9d> he said. <e2><80><9c>They took her to keep her from hurting herself.<e2><80><9d> Davis added that he did not know why his sister had a gun. <e2><80><9c>I<e2><80><99>ve never known her to have a gun.<e2><80><9d> According to BSO, deputies have responded to calls at Davis<e2><80><99> home at least 79 times since March 2008 for reasons ranging from suspicious incidents, reports of a mentally ill person, breaking and entering, and disturbances.  Most recently, deputies had responded to calls of a mentally ill person at Davis<e2><80><99> home three times since Nov. 30. Among the dozens of times that deputies responded to calls at Davis<e2><80><99> house was one incident in December 2009 classified as a shooting. Veda Coleman-Wright, acting director of media relations for BSO, said that call proved to be unfounded. <e2><80><9c>Our deputies found no evidence of any shooting,<e2><80><99><e2><80><99> she said. <e2><80><9c>There was no written report, and Linda, the suspect, she was the one who actually made that call.<e2><80><99><e2><80><99> Andrew Davis described his sister as <e2><80><9c>very educated,<e2><80><9d> and said she worked as a medical technician prior to her <e2><80><9c>accident,<e2><80><9d> which he declined to describe as anything more than a <e2><80><9c>breakdown.<e2><80><9d> He insisted that Linda Davis was not the type of person to hurt someone else unprovoked. <e2><80><9c>Someone had to bother her to get her riled up,<e2><80><9d> he said. <e2><80><9c>She never came out of the house.<e2><80><9d> Neighbors in the Mainlands of Tamarac Lakes neighborhood where Davis and Shamburg lived said police frequently were called to Davis<e2><80><99> home, and that on at least one occasion she tossed her clothes, food and other items out the front door of her house. But they also described Davis as a woman who tended her yard often <e2><80><94> making it the greenest in the neighborhood <e2><80><94> and who hosed down her driveway every morning.  Shamburg, too, was known for keeping up her property.  <e2><80><9c>She was very quiet,<e2><80><9d> said Betty Price, who lives two doors down from Shamburg. <e2><80><9c>She worked out in her yard quite a bit, and even in the neighbors<e2><80><99> yards. She would just pull weeds.<e2><80><99><e2><80><99> Price said she does not know the nature of the relationship between Shamburg and Davis. <e2><80><9c>I never saw them together,<e2><80><99><e2><80><99> she said. <e2><80><9c>I don<e2><80><99>t know.<e2><80><99><e2><80><99>       Six same-sex couples suing to marry in Florida and actress Sharon Gless will be honored Sunday by the state<c2><92>s largest LGBT-rights group.            1394897677        Bolivia<e2><80><99>s top anti-corruption official was found guilty of trying to extort $30,000 from a wealthy Bolivian businessman who fled to Miami after being charged with <e2><80><9c>illegal enrichment<e2><80><9d> back home.                Two men and a woman were arrested Tuesday in Weston after detectives from the Broward Sheriff<e2><80><99>s Offices foiled their plans to burglarize a home.
