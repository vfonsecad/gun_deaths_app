Investigators cordoned off the scene at 18250 NW 27th Ave. and about a dozen employees remained inside the fast-food restaurant through late morning as investigators poured over evidence following the shooting.  Two victims, both males in their 20s, were airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital, news partner CBS 4 reported. The gray Mercedes SUV they were in, was riddled with bullets and blood pooled on the pavement where police markers pinpointed evidence.              According to witnesses, the shooters left the scene and drove off in a black vehicle. They remain at large. One of the victims, Michael Sexton, 23, was in stable but critical condition Friday afternoon after bullets hit his lung and knee. Family waited outside the trauma center for word on his condition.
