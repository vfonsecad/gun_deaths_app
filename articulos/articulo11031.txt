1 1 PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A motorist who pointed a firearm at a state trooper near Sisters is dead after shots were fired, just a day after a motorist died in another part of Oregon after a shootout with a trooper. The latest incident occurred just before noon Friday after a trooper stopped a vehicle on Highway 20 near milepost 90 following what troopers described as a "driving complaint." The driver pointed a gun at the trooper and fled. Troopers deployed spike strips, but his car continued on the highway and turned onto Harrington Loop. A trooper rammed his car, causing it to slow and stop between two patrol cars. That's when the suspect again showed a gun. Shots were fired, police said, and the driver was found dead in the vehicle. Police said it was too early to confirm he died of shots from officers. Two state troopers, who were not named, were placed on paid administrative leave, as is standard in officer-involved shootings. A day earlier, a motorist fired at a trooper along Interstate 84 near The Dalles. The trooper was wounded with minor injuries, and his assailant died from the trooper's bullet.  So, here is the thing. The only person who ever saw the dead guy pull a gun was a cop. We only have their say so that it happened. Oh, I'm sure they found a gun on the dead guy, but was itÃÂ reallyÃÂ his? News flash, COPS LIE! They lie to keep themselves out of trouble, and they will lie to get others in trouble. Did this one (or more) cop lie. No clue, I wasn't there. But cops over all have lost my faith and trust.ÃÂ   R.I.P. Billy   All these armed idiots with day-dreams of "mowing down the pigs"...  At this rate, most of the OSP will be on administrative leave instead of out patrolling.  I drove through there yesterday afternoon about 4pm and saw all of the police activity. ÃÂ I was pretty obvious a crime had occurred and it was likely a death was involved. ÃÂ I've seen plenty of similar situations (the mass police groupings on the side of the road) and never seen a news story to explain it so it is nice to get the story for once.  He obviously wanted to be shot.   Suicide by cop?  What part of "pointing a gun at a cop" is a wise idea?ÃÂ  Does one think anything good will happen from that?? That's like "oh hey, I'm going to grab this rattlesnake by the head, what could possibly go wrong?"   To the Trolls below and others: ANYONE who gets a gun out during a police procedure runs a very high risk of being shot dead, and rightfully so. Say it with me....POLICE.  Guns never solve problems, prevent crime, or protect you.ÃÂ  This officer is a perfect example of a gun nut looking for blood.   Anyone STUPID enough to brandish a gun around a police officer does so at his/her own risk.ÃÂ  Common sense should tell them that.  I'm very sad that now cops are getting antsy and shooting people dead rather than any other means. ÃÂ One incident and now some people are going to die from a scared cop   I am very glad the troopers were safe, and that the suspect died! I am very glad the troopers can go home to their families! Been there, done that! And, yes, I am glad the troopers can get to go home safely! Hopefully, they and their families will get over this speed-bump of life protecting others (and themselves)!   Maybe it's this heat.   Until Oregon reinstills respect for the law these incidents will continue to happen...maybe parents could help ...  At least let viewers know of the sex of an assailant...   suicied by cop ?   Awesome, another dead criminal!  Didn't y'all hear?ÃÂ  ODFW declared it open season on law-breakers, and the OSP is ready to shoot and kill anyone who pulls a weapon on them.ÃÂ    @Chuck Yelton .The video is all over youtube you clown!  @waffle The officer?!? The man who has taken an oath to protect us by risking his life? If a person is willing to point and/or fire a weapon at the police what do you think will happen to you if you or your family cross paths with this guy when he's in a bad mood? Guns carried by the military and law enforcement help protect your constitutionally protected rights...  @waffle ... gun nut?ÃÂ  ... dollars to Winchell's it was 'roid rage.  "Common Sense" is a myth.  @twig No one has been killed until they actually fired at an officer in these recent incidents. How do you expect it to be handled when police are being shot and/or killed? Put yourself in the officer's position. You are walking up to a vehicle, the window rolls down, and a gun is pointed at you. What do you do?  @twigÃÂ You point a gun at a cop, you should expect to get shot.  Twig........grow up and be a branch.  Do you really really believe police enjoy shooting people??   @twigÃÂ Please don't be such a hateful liberal.  @johnponceÃÂ  ÃÂ On our local TV station website (I live in Central Oregon), all references to the driver are male.  Oh....SUICIDE!!!ÃÂ  LMAO!!ÃÂ ÃÂ  You had me going there...!!!   @pdxd2 "OSP is ready to shoot and kill anyone who pulls a weapon on them. "Sounds reasonable to me.  @pdxd2ÃÂ ODFW has nothing to do with it.ÃÂ  If you pull a gun on a law enforcement officer, you'd better either; A) Be a damn good shot, and have means to go into hiding pretty quickly. or B) Pray that you are drawing down on a law enforcement officer with a good deal of restraint.ÃÂ  By all definitions, if you draw a gun on someone you are considered (legally) to be a threat to their lives. There isn't a court in the land that would likely bring charges against you, civillian or law enforcement officer.ÃÂ   Oh really?ÃÂ  The same guns used to go overseas and kill innocent women and children?ÃÂ  The same guns that enforce the Patriot Act, the NDAA, the IRS, and oh so many other "constitutional luxuries"?ÃÂ    @Shawn AlleyÃÂ Ummm..Shawn, PRETTY sure Waffle was out on a Troll, and ya took the bait. Just my opinion, I could be wrong.  @BamaReb2ÃÂ @twigÃÂ  Point a gun at me, expect to get shot, unless it is a cop of course.  @Rob C 503ÃÂ  ÃÂ I don't think they enjoy it a bit, but it's becoming a bit alarming when there's 2 incidents in as many days. ÃÂ I'll keep that in mind the next time I think about driving a bit too much over the speed limit! ÃÂ Those routine traffic stops can be iffy.   @hankhandsomeÃÂ @twigÃÂ I'm a liberal but think the officer did the right thing. If someone drew a gun on me I would defend myself. How many chances do you give a criminal? We need to give the victims survival some thought. Our justice system needs a overhaul. When the criminal has more rights than the victim we are doing something wrong.  @hankhandsome Please don't be a retard.  @MikeyÃÂ  ÃÂ We all make typos -- I thought they were saying "juicied" -- didn't quite know what that meant. ÃÂ =)  @MarkKpic I never said that ODFW anything to do with this.ÃÂ  I was making a joke that ODFW had opened season on lawbreakers to be shot by Oregon State Police.ÃÂ  I'm not stupid, I know that ODFW doesn't create the laws, it's called humor, you should try it sometime.  @MarkKpicÃÂ @pdxd2ÃÂ  ÃÂ So if a cop pulls a gun a person can assume their life is in danger and they need to defend themselves?   @Rob C 503 This is the thing that I think a lot of people miss, or ignore.ÃÂ  The police have to deal with the scum of society every day.ÃÂ  They have to deal with threats to their lives every day.ÃÂ  They have to deal with the anti-police rhetoric every day.ÃÂ    @SunDownerÃÂ @Rob C 503ÃÂ We're also still on hightened security for possible terrorist activities and police are much more aware of the risks than the average citizen. ÃÂ We won't know how much of a factor that has been in the minds of the officers involved in situations like this (especially in the more rural settings where backup may be hours away).  @Rob C 503ÃÂ Did you see the very first sentence in my original response to you? ÃÂ I said, "I don't think they enjoy it a bit". ÃÂ I feel stronger than that, actually -- I think 99% hate it and have to live with it the rest of their lives. ÃÂ You never see me on here bashing LE when word comes that "he's been placed on paid administrative leave..." (we'll have to start watching, because it's usually the known conservatives here who say that). ÃÂ I totally get it -- it's not some woo hoo paid holiday. ÃÂ Taking the life of another, whether in the line of duty or by accident, is nothing to take lightly.   Sunny, I never suggested you are "shielded".  But do you really, and answer me, think law enforcement enjoys, gets a thrill, feels empowered by shooting someone ???  @Rob C 503ÃÂ  ÃÂ Actually, just because I don't live in a major metropolitan area doesn't mean I'm shielded from what's going on in the world. ÃÂ And we're all certainly more aware of it on a daily basis with the flood of information available on the internet. ÃÂ   Sunny, there's a lot of bad people out there.  And they see them every day.  Alarming ?? Do a ride along. You'll really be alarmed at the degradation of our society.  @SunDownerÃÂ @RandyHÃÂ @twigÃÂ @StealthActivistÃÂ  If it's a sarcastic question intended to insult hard-working law enforcement people who are constantly being attacked by a segment of the community who have no idea what it's like to do that job.. ÃÂ then yes. ÃÂ ÃÂ   @RandyHÃÂ @twigÃÂ @StealthActivistÃÂ  ÃÂ So is that the new "norm" here? ÃÂ A person asks a question you don't like and that earns them the "developmentally disabled" or "stupid" title? ÃÂ Seems fair -- good to know.  @twigÃÂ @MarkKpicÃÂ @pdxd2ÃÂ If you pull a gun on a police officer, you will be killed most likely, that is good. ÃÂ Only a totally stupid person would do this, probably someone like yourself.  @twigÃÂ @MarkKpicÃÂ @pdxd2ÃÂ  Are you developmentally disabled or something?
