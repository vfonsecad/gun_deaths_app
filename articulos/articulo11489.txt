1 1 Police are still trying to determine why a 76-year-old Polo man shot and killed a 73-year-old Polo woman in her home Monday afternoon and then hanged and shot himself. Dead are Marcellene Jones, 73, 604 W. North St., Polo, and Paul J. Busser, Sr., 76, 714 W. .Fulton, also of Polo. According to a press release issued by the Polo Police Chief Dennis Christen late Tuesday afternoon, Busser had been at Jones' residence with a handgun when he shot her, "fatally wounding her." "Busser then hung and shot himself with the same handgun fatally wounding himself," the release said. Christen said Jones and Busser knew each other. "They were acquaintances," he said. Both bodies were found in Jones' home shortly after 12:30 p.m. on Monday. The bodies were discovered by a friend of Jones who went to visit her at her home, got no answer at the front door, and then went around to the back door and saw her lying on the floor. That person then went to a downtown business and called 911 at 12:34 p.m. Polo Police Officer Shawn Knight went to Jones' home where both bodies were discovered. Officers from the Ogle County Sheriff's Department and Forreston Police Department soon arrived to assist with the investigation. Christen said investigators believe both deaths occurred earlier that morning. Ogle County Sheriff Michael Harn said the bodies were found after officers responded to a "person needing assistance call" made by the person who was trying to visit Jones. The coroner was called to the scene and Illinois State Police crime scene investigators were also called to conduct a crime scene investigation. The bodies were removed from the residence by the Ogle County Coroner and autopsies were conducted on Tuesday. Police vehicles were also in front of Busser's home on Monday afternoon. "The incident remains under investigation pending autopsy results," said the press release. This is the second murder-suicide in the Polo area, and the third in Ogle County, in a little more than a year. On Feb. 25, Jack E. Bond, 85, shot his wife, Dorothy F. Bond, 86, in their home at 4238 N. Armour Road, about 3.5 miles southeast of Stillman Valley. The two reportedly were ill. On May 31, 2012, Gerald Fossler, 49, shot Vickie L Weegens, 55, in the front yard of the farmhouse they shared at 4170 Evergreen Road, about 3 miles southeast of Polo, after a domestic dispute. He then then moved her body to the backyard and shot himself. PREVIOUS UPDATE Police have yet to release the names of two people who were found dead early afternoon in a home at 604 North St., in Polo. As of Tuesday morning, Ogle County Sheriff Michael Harn who is in charge of the investigation with the assistance of the Polo Police Department had yet to release the names, sex, ages, or manner of their deaths, or their relationship to one another. Harn did say one person lived in the home. Harn said the autopsies were already in progress at the Ogle County morgue. Both bodies were found in a home at 604 W. North St., Polo, shortly after 12:30 p.m. on Monday. Harn said a man went to visit the woman who lived in the home Monday afternoon. When he got no answer at the front door, he went around to the back door and saw her lying on the floor. The man then went to a downtown business and called 911 at 12:34 p.m. Harn said Polo Police Officer Shawn Knight then went to the home where he discovered the second victim. Two police cars were stationed at a nearby home at 716 W. Fulton most of yesteday afternoon. Harn declined to say if that had any connection to the North Street home investigation. Polo police found the bodies after responding to a "person needing assistance call" made at 12:34 p.m. by a woman visiting the resident, Harn said. The coroner was called to the scene, and Illinois State Police crime scene investigators were also on site. A neighbor said that the home was occupied by a single elderly woman, possibly in her 70s. Harn reiterated an earlier statement that the public is not in jeopardy. No arrests have been made. More information may be released later today, Harn said.
