1 1 1 man was killed, a woman was injured while sitting in a car in a driveway in Opa-Locka on August 22, 2013. (Source: CBS4) OPA LOCKA (CBSMiami) â A man was killed, a woman injured in a drive-by shooting in Opa-locka. It happened around 3 a.m. in front of a home on NW 133rd Street and 30th Avenue. The vehicle had several bullet holes and the window was shot out. According to family, the man who died was 27-year-old David Boothe. Frank Boothe, David’s father, said his son and his girlfriend had gone out to the car for a smoke when they were shot. “I was laying in the bed and I heard gunshots and I ran out. My son’s car was backed up almost to the wall. I checked on the passenger side and he wasn’t moving. He was laying in the car with his head back and I went to the side. The window was shot and he laid there lifeless,” said Boothe. The Bootheâs girlfriend was airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital’s Ryder Trauma Center with non-life threatening injuries. She was treated and released. âI heard about 5 to 5, 7, 8 shots like âda, da, da, da, daâ, it sounded like a firecracker to me, I told my lady to get on the floor,â said neighbor Curtis Smith. Smith said he ran outside after the shooting stopped and found his car had been grazed by several bullets. Thatâs when he noticed the shattered glass and bullet holes in Bootheâs car. âI just see a bullet, one through his head, just shot up, I couldnât take it, I had to go in the house,â said Smith. As police work to figure out who pulled the trigger, Bootheâs father said justice will happen one way or the other. “His turn is gonna come one way or another. What goes around comes around, if I don’t get him the Lord will,” said Boothe. Witnesses told police they saw a white Pontiac speed down the street after the shots were fired.
