1 1 6:15 a.m. CDT, October 6, 2013 Two men were killed and four others wounded in South Side shootings, according to police. A 46-year-old man shot in the head about 10:30 p.m. along with a 21-year-old, leaving the older man dead and the younger in critical condition. Someone fired at the pair from inside a dark-colored car in the 11000 block of South Vernon Avenue in the Roseland neighborhood, police said. A spokeswoman for the Cook County medical examiner's office identified the 46-year-old as Arlanders Watkins. He lived less than two blocks north of where he was killed, and was pronounced dead about 40 minutes after he was shot.  Another Far South Side shooting earlier in the day also left one dead and one wounded. Both of the men shot were 19 and were attacked about 2:20 p.m. in the 11700 block of South Morgan Street in the West Pullman neighborhood, police said. One of the 19-year-olds was wounded in the foot and taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center. The other was pronounced dead at the same hospital about 80 minutes after he was shot, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office. A spokeswoman for that office identified him as Cory Atwater, of the same block where he was shot.  An attack in Englewood left two men wounded Saturday morning. The men, 22 and 23, were shot in the 1700 block of West 64th Street about 11:50 a.m. and both were taken to John H. Stroger, Jr. Hospital of Cook County. The older man was shot in the chest and listed in serious condition while the younger man's wound, in his shoulder, was less serious, police said. pnickeas@tribune.com | Twitter: @PeterNickeas dawilliams@tribune.com | Twitter: @neacynewslady  Copyright © 2014 Chicago Tribune Company, LLC Send us your breaking news information, photos and video: tips@tribune.com Get breaking news  email  & text alerts.
