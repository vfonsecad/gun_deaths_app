1 1 The Warren County Sheriff's Department is investigating the death of a woman who was found with a gunshot wound Tuesday afternoon. Sheriff Martin Pace said deputies were called to 675 Stenson Road, just off Highway 27. Pace said when deputies arrived on the scene, Katherine Thurston was found on the floor with a gunshot wound to the chest. Sheriff Pace said, "We have recovered a hand gun on the scene, and do not really have anything at this time. This is still an open investigation in its earliest stages. We do have an autopsy scheduled today at the Mississippi State Crime Lab." Her husband found her in their mobile home and called the sheriff. We have learned from the family that she was apparently shot with her own gun after someone apparently broke into the trailer and ransacked it. Thurston's father said he believes she was shot by an intruder. Thurston was the mother of 11 and 17-year-old boys. She had been named Warren County School Bus Driver of the Year, recently. Wednesday morning Sheriff Pace said no one was in custody. Sheriff Pace said he would not have any more to say about the case until the autopsy was complete.  Copyright 2013 MSNewsNow.
