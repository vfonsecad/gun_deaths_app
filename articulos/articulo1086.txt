1 By Amy LangeFox 2 News   DETROIT (WJBK) -- Robert Jackson heard the gunfire, but didn't know where it was coming from.   "A lot of boom, boom, boom, boom.  It sounded like a cannon," he said.   Just a couple houses away on Marx on Detroit's east side, 24-year-old D'Angelo Allen had been shot and killed.   It is Detroit's first homicide of the New Year.   "It was pretty loud, so I was trying to get the hell in the house," said J.R., another neighbor who also heard the gunfire early Tuesday morning.   A 21-year-old exotic dancer from 007 Gentleman's Club told police that Allen, a man she had met a week before, had picked her up at the club and brought her back to the house where she fell asleep.   She said he woke her up, had a gun, and was demanding sex.   She complied, but she ended up grabbing the weapon and shot him.   The young woman was able to escape and get to police, but she couldn't tell them where she had been.   It wasn't until Tuesday night police were able to track down the house and the body.   Police say Allen had been shot multiple times.   The young woman is now in custody as investigators work to determine if she'll face charges or if the shooting was justified.
