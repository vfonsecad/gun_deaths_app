State Police still investigating fatal shooting in McNeil                                   0 comments                                        The investigation is continuing into last Saturdayâs shooting in McNeil, where a Columbia County Sheriffâs Office deputy shot and killed a man with a knife. Following standard procedure in officer-involved shootings, special agents of the Arkansas State Police Criminal Investigation Division are investigating the shooting at the request of Sheriff Mike Loe. Deputy Sheriff Koby Schmittou shot Larry Pace, 60, on Front Street between Olive and Oak streets in McNeil. Schmittou had gotten out of his patrol car to question Pace, who was walking along the side of the road, apparently picking up cans. Pace apparently pulled a knife on Schmittou, and Schmittou opened fire, wounding the man. Pace was treated at the scene by the Columbia County Ambulance Service and still had a pulse when he was taken to Magnolia Regional Medical Center, where he died. Schmittou was not hurt. âCID agents are preparing an investigative file which will include an autopsy report from the State Crime Laboratory along with other forensic analysis and witness statements,â said Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler. âThe case file will be submitted to the prosecuting attorney who will determine if the deputy used deadly force consistent with state laws,â he said. Schmittou is on paid administrative leave pending the results of the investigation. Saturdayâs shooting may have been the first time in Columbia County history in which a law enforcement officer has killed a person in the line of duty. Two Columbia County sheriffs have been shot and killed in the line of duty. Sheriff Sidney Smith McMath died April 22, 1911. McMath returned fire and killed his assailant before dying. Sheriff B.E. Greer was shot and killed on November 7, 1919 by a man hiding under a bed. Greerâs assailant was lynched. Funeral for Pace will be 10 a.m. Monday at Marks Funeral Home in Magnolia. Pace would have turned 61 on January 10. The Rev. Rickey Joe will be the eulogist. CLICK HERE to see magnoliareporter.comâs first-day report on this incident.
