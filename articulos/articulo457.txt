1  James Gentry Authorities say two brothers are facing murder charges in the 2008 murder of a Coconut Creek man. Tim Gentry, 38, and James Gentry, 33, have been arrested and charged in the Dec. 21, 2008 murder of 64-year-old Ralph Apuzzo, the Broward Sheriff's Office said Wednesday. According to the BSO, Apuzzo met the brothers at a bar in Oakland Park and invited him back to his condo in the 2400 block of Northwest 49th Terrace. Once inside the condo, the Gentry brothers tried to rob Apuzzo, who fought back. Apuzzo was killed in the violent struggle, the BSO said. The murder was investigated at the time but became a cold case until BSO Crime Lab analysts recently tested evidence from the case. DNA from the scene was found to match the Gentry brothers. Tim Gentry is already behind bars, serving time in the High Desert State Prison in Clark County, Nevada, on unrelated charges. He's awaiting transfer to Broward County. James Gentry was in custody in Tulsa, Oklahoma and is fighting extradition to Broward, the BSO said.
