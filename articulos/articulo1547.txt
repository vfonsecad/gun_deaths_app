Suspect charged with murder as community mourns death of Henrico storekeeper                                                                 BILL McKELWAY Richmond Times-Dispatch                                                                Richmond Times-Dispatch                                        Farooq M. Bhimdi, a Pakistani native shot dead inside his neighborhood store Monday night, was no stranger to violence, but family members and co-workers said his always supportive attitude never revealed stress or a sense of fear. âIt wasnât pressure; it was love,â Tashfeen Bhimdi said Wednesday night, visiting his fatherâs store hours after the 64-year-old was eulogized as a martyr in an Islamic service attended by more than 100 mourners. A graduate student in business at Boston University, Tashfeen Bhimdi said his father never pressured his three children despite the manâs grueling hours behind the counter to support them. A sister of Tashfeenâs, Hudaidah, is an immigration lawyer in Northern Virginia. She has described her father as living the American dream and experiencing success through hard work. Tashfeen Bhimdi said Wednesday night that plans for the store are uncertain. Two days after his fatherâs death, streams of visitors and friends were continuing to come by the cluttered emporium, its entryway festooned with mementos. A 19-year-old eastern Henrico resident, a frequent visitor to Bhimdiâs Express Way Convenience Store on Mechanicsville Turnpike, meanwhile, made a court appearance Wednesday morning on murder and a firearms charge and was ordered held without bond. Jamon Burroughs, a Virginia Randolph School graduate who was unemployed but did occasional tattooing work, was arrested and charged with murder in Bhimdiâs death late Tuesday night at a cousinâs home less than a mile from the store and just over 24 hours after the shooting. Burroughsâ mother and his girlfriend said Wednesday that he was at his familyâs Elkridge Lane apartment the night of the shooting Monday, more than 2 miles from the store. âWe were watching cable; it had just been fixed,â Burroughsâ mother said, asking not to be identified because of the volatile atmosphere in eastern Henrico stemming from Bhimdiâs death. She said her son rarely ventured out of the home and spent hours working on tattoo designs and with his girlfriend. Burroughs is due in court Feb. 13. Burroughs has no record of felony arrests, a prosecutor said in court Wednesday morning. Jill Smith, a store employee, said Bhimdi was the past owner of the Government Road Food Mart in Richmond that figured in a violent robbery 21 years ago. News stories show that Pakistani native Kareem Virani was paralyzed from gunshot wounds during the daylight robbery and later died. âHe didnât talk about that,â Smith said Wednesday, noting that Bhimdi never dwelled on danger. Video cameras â which caught images of the shooter Monday night â figured in the arrest and conviction in the 1992 case. Tashfeen Bhimdi said the father was keenly aware of security issues, and could monitor the surveillance equipment at the Henrico store from the family home in Glen Allen. But Bhimdi negated reports from multiple customers that his father had access to a gun at the Mechanicsville Turnpike store. âIt would be just like him to pretend he had a gun,â Tashfeen Bhimdi said, âbut he didnât have one.â A friend of Burroughs, Jordan Morris, 23, said Wednesday that Burroughs and other young men often went to the Express Way âbecause (Bhimdi) had lower prices. We all knew him and he knew us. He was a good man.â Morris said sheâd never seen Burroughs with a gun and that Burroughsâ short stature matched his reclusive personality. Arrest records list Burroughs as being 5â3â and weighing 150 pounds. Facebook pictures show Burroughs to be heavily muscled and tattooed; in one picture he is covered with fake $20 bills in a bathtub. Bhimdiâs death has raised a powerful outcry from eastern Henrico residents who said the father of three has been a treasure to them for some 20 years. âI told him every time I went in there how much I love him,â said Julia Jordan, who met Bhimdiâs family Wednesday evening at the store. âHe always called me Peaches.â Bhimdiâs death was the second shooting death in the past two months of a Pakistani-American food market owner. Mohammad Taib, 59, was shot to death at his Food Mart store in late November off Erich Road and Midlothian Turnpike in Richmond. He was the father of five children. The shootings helped prompt Malik Khan, chairman of the Asian American Society of Central Virginia, to ask for a meeting with Henricoâs police chief and Frank Thornton, a member of the county Board of Supervisors. âAsian-American business owners do not feel safe,â he said in an email after Bhimdiâs death. Similar efforts are under way in Richmond and Chesterfield County. Inside the Islamic Center of Virginia on Wednesday, more than 100 men kneeled and bowed before a casket carrying the body of Bhimdi as the female members of his family monitored the proceeding in a nearby room by closed circuit. In his office before the service, Imam Ammar Amonette bemoaned funerals at the center for two Pakistani shopkeepers in just two months. âI hope that these tragic events will become a vehicle for this area to reconcile this violence and to find a way toward peace,â Amonette said. âIt would be something wonderful to see that happen in Richmond.â bmckelway@timesdispatch.com (804) 649-6601          Posted in         News,         Henrico                  on                       Thursday, January 31, 2013 12:00 am.
