1 1 A Toledo man who was wounded after he came out of a South Toledo bar about 2 a.m. today and began shooting at a crowd of patrons and security officers in the parking lot has died, Toledo police said. Marvin Smith, Jr., 24, of Toledo was shot at least three times in an exchange of gun fire; he died several hours later in the University of Toledo Medical Center, formerly the Medical College of Ohio, police said. A security officer was shot twice, but his wounds were non-life threatening, police said. The security officer was injured in his arm and leg, Sgt. Tim Noble said.  Additional security officers exchanged gun fire with Mr. Smith as they went, on foot, through the parking lot at the Lighthouse Bar, 2605 Broadway. A large group of people was in the parking lot and multiple shots were fired, but it appears at this time that no one else was injured, police said. Police have not confirmed Mr. Smith's motive for the shooting, Sergeant Noble said, though they suspect he may have had a gang affiliation. The case remains under investigation.  24-year-old dies at UTMC, several hours after gunfire was exchanged outside a bar
