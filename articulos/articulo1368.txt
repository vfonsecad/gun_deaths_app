A Guernsey County man who killed his young son before turning the gun on himself had recently separated from his wife and was unemployed and depressed, officials said today. Russell J. Ball, 36, was found dead yesterday at his Cambridge Township home along with his 5-year-old son, Jacob. Guernsey County Sheriff Michael McCauley said Ball had a lengthy text message conversation Tuesday night with his estranged wife, Jessica Ball, in which he threatened to kill himself. She didn’t take him seriously. He’d made similar threats before, McCauley said. But yesterday, when Jessica Ball arrived to pick up Jacob from day care, workers there told him he had never arrived. The day care contacted the sheriff’s office, and deputies met Jessica Ball in Russell Ball’s driveway at 60043 Piedmont Rd. shortly before 4 p.m. McCauley would not identify the weapon Russell Ball used, but said it was an older firearm. Autopsies will be performed to determine whether drugs or alcohol were involved, but McCauley said he didn’t suspect they were. Most Popular Most Shared Dispatch Media Group
