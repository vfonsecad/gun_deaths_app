1 1 Gilbert Ralph Montano, a 24-year-old Latino, was fatally shot Sunday, Sept. 1, in the 400 block of West 50th Street in Vermont Square, according to Los Angeles County coronerâs records. Montano was involved in a traffic accident with Anthony Smallwood, 40, shortly before 5 a.m. while the men were driving west on 50th Street, said LAPD Det. Supervisor Chris Barling. The two cut each other off and chased each other, then stopped near Figueroa Street to get out of their vehicles and talk about the accident, Barling said.  A man then walked up to the two, asked where they were from, shot them and fled, Barling said.   Montano was pronounced dead at the scene at 5:05 a.m., said coronerâs spokesman Ed Winter.  Smallwood also died at the scene. A suspect in the slayings, Derrick Antonio Henry, was arrested Sept. 4 on suspicion of murder, Barling said. He is being held without bail, according to L.A. County Sheriffâs Department records.  Barling said investigators believe that Henry is a gang member but Smallwood and Montano are not.

Now that some bad luck there Neither of the victims were gang members and were killed, none of this would have happen if they were driving normal, this is what road rage does to people, whats the point of cutting people off, never stop on a lonely street this is where cowards Lie in wait, the only reason the shooter was brave because he had a gun otherwise he would have never approached the victims. Tragic...Gilbert"Gee"Montano was a cool cat...so sorry to hear this tragic tale...I spoke with Gee just days before this happened...so very sad for one so young to have been taken so early...R.I.P. "Gee" Rest well, Gee.  You were a good guy and I always enjoyed talking with you.  You will be missed.   two tragic victims of the neighborhood loser, psychopath, lurking aimlessly around.  Gilbert was polite and well mannered despite the situation he found himself in....really sad. My heart goes out to the Montano family. I am a family member of Anthony Smallwood who we lost the same day at the same scene.  We will be praying for your family.  Roadrage that early in the morning My comment was made to point out a flaw too many people have they drive like they own the road and act like they can just cut people off when ever they want, I wasn't Implying that they deserve to die because of their bad driving habits, but what got them to the location in the first place, hint road rage, now if one of the drivers broke down and the other driver stop to help and that lowlife gangster killed them, I wouldn't have made that comment, all I'm saying is people need to mind their driving habits, I'm sure this wasn't their first road rage Encounter, I'm sure they were good people with awful driving habits.
