1   OAKLAND -- A man fatally shot himself Thursday morning as sheriff's deputies tried to serve eviction papers on him at his Dimond district apartment, authorities said. The man's name was not immediately released pending notification of relatives.  He is believed to be in his 70s. Police found the man's body about 11:20 a.m. inside the apartment in the 3700 block of Fruitvale Avenue near Damuth Street. Authorities said deputies heard a noise outside the man's apartment before entering about 10:15 a.m. but could not tell for sure what it was. Once inside, they saw the man lying on a bed holding a gun in his hands but because the apartment was dark they could not see any injuries to him, authorities said. The deputies backed off and called for assistance which brought dozens of police and other deputies to the scene. For an hour or so, authorities tried to make contact with the man but were unsuccessful. Police fired some bean bag rounds through a window in an effort to get the man's attention. Officers then saw his body and when they went inside found that he had fatally shot himself. A gun was found near him, authorities said. No gunshots were fired by police or deputies. During the standoff Fruitvale Avenue and other streets were shut down and other apartments and residences evacuated. A nearby preschool was put on lockdown.
