LOLO, Mont. – Fire managers at the Lolo Creek Complex of fires near the town of Lolo focused Sunday on the northern edge of the fire that’s heading toward a Bonneville Power Administration power line.  Fire spokesman Thomas Kempton said contingency plans were being made should the 16-square-mile fire reach the 500-kilovolt line that’s about a mile and a half from the fire.  He said about 800 personnel and seven helicopters are assigned to the lightning-caused blaze that destroyed five homes last week.  He said firefighters have had problems with wasp stings. It’s unclear how many firefighters have been stung, but about six who had allergic reactions have received medical attention.  Kempton said U.S. Highway 12 is open with a reduced speed limit to keep firefighters in the area safe.
