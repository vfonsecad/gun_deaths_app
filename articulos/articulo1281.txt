(WTVR) — Chesterfield Police have obtained warrants for a man in the death of a woman and her mother found in their Ettrick home Monday night. Herbert C. Bland Jr., of Dinwiddie County, is charged with two counts of first degree murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Bland was shot Monday afternoon at his home on Harris Drive. His father, Herbert Bland Sr., was found shot dead outside the home when investigators arrived. The bodies of Barbara Fassett, 65, and her daughter, Elizabeth S. Fassett, 42, were discovered later Monday night when a UPS driver arrived at their home to make a delivery. Police said Bland, 23, was Elizabeth Fassett’s ex-boyfriend. Chesterfield police said they had a feeling that the double murder was connected to a shooting in Dinwiddie County. “I can’t put it any other way,” Chesterfield police Maj. Terry Patterson said. “It was a hunch [and] we contacted Dinwiddie.”  Bland remains in the hospital where he is being treated for a gunshot wound. The Dinwiddie County Sheriff’s Office is investigating his involvement in the Harris Drive shooting. RELATED:    Get a 2014 Golf Card for $179!
