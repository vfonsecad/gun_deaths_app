If any of his family members read this please know that he loved his family. He always talked about his family whether it was his mom, aunt, dad, son or daughter he was very proud of where he came from and who you were. That may not help at this time but I feel the need to tell you. May God help you through this tragic time...peace and love I agree with everything written by the previous poster. This confirms that Edwin was genuine. He was an amazing person to encounter and a wonderful person to know. I will always cherish the moments we shared and the stories he told so vividly. He was a profound person who wanted to see the growth of everyone around him. He did not believe in being idle. He thought of himself as peacemaker and wanted a community children could thrive in. His legacy will live on in his children and the many hearts he touched. As we move forward, it is important to remember how joyful he was and how much he loved his friends, family, order, and decency.  I want to honor the journey he was headed down towards being a positive impact on his community. As we mourn his death we must uplift his life.
