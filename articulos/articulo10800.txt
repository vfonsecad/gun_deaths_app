The Montgomery County Coronerâs Office said the victim as 52-year-old Sheila Crum, and there are questions regarding the way in which she died. Officers responded to the home in the 2600 block around 11 p.m. after a male, believed to be the womanâs husband, called 911 reporting his wife had shot herself. The husband hasnât been named by police. He was home at the time of the shooting and also sustained some minor injuries possibly related to the incident, according to Miami Twp. police Sgt. Paul Nienhaus. His role in the case has not been determined but he was not shot, Nienhaus said. âIt came across to us as a possible suicide and it does appear to be that way but there are still some facts we are looking into and to try and line things up. âWeâre not sure who played what role, or if any role was played at all,â Nienhaus said. A rifle, which is what detectives believe was used to fire the fatal shot, was recovered from the scene and has been taken in for evidence. The womanâs body was taken to the Montgomery County Coronerâs Office. Officers found open bottles of alcohol inside the house, but it has not been determined if it played any type of role in the event. Nienhaus said early Friday morning there was âa lot of evidence to sift through,â and maintained âthere are still a couple questions up in the air.â Robert Rike, who lives in the area, said he wasnât aware of the incident in his neighborhood until he turned on his TV. âI watch TV and it seems like itâs always somewhere else where this stuff happens,â Rike said. Sgt. Nienhaus said it seems like only one shot was fired at the home on Thursday night. âThis investigation will continue for a little while,â he said. âItâs definitely not a one-night type of thing.â  © 2014 Cox Media Group.
