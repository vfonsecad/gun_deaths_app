ASH FLAT  Authorities in Sharp County have arrested a suspect after a man was found shot to death in Ash Flat. Sheriff Mark Counts says Sharp County dispatch received a call early Saturday about a vehicle accident in Ash Flat. Once there, officers discovered the driver of the vehicle, Severin Simpson, dead from a gunshot wound to the head. Mountain Home radio station KTLO reports that two people witnessed the shooting and identified the alleged gunman. Counts said authorities arrested Christopher Bryant of Salem without incident after a brief manhunt Saturday afternoon. Bryant is being held at the Sharp County jail and authorities did not know if he had an attorney.
