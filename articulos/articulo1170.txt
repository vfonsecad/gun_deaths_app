1   A standoff between an armed man and Minneapolis police ended Friday afternoon when the man apparently committed suicide.    Police received a 911 call about 1:30 p.m. concerning a man with a gun at a home in the 2400 block of Pierce Street Northeast. A SWAT team arrived and set up a perimeter around the house, and police negotiators made contact with the man.  After several hours, SWAT team members looked inside the house and saw the man, apparently not moving. They later determined that he had died of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.  The man's identity was not immediately released Friday, Jan. 4.
