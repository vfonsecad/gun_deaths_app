1 1 Monday, April  7, 2014 People across the nation (and in several other countries) are posting videos of themselves jumping into frigid water to show support for a 5-month-old northwest Missouri boy who is battling cancer. Landon Shaw, of rural Tarkio is battling a rare cancer that first hit his kidney and now is in his brain. His family is on Medicaid, which wont cover all of the costs coming in. Someone shot a driver in the leg near Interstate 435 and Interstate 470 Sunday night in Kansas City — the 13th such shooting at a motorist in the area within a month. Ten of the shootings have occurred in Kansas City since March 8, with single shootings occurring in Leawood, Blue Springs and Lee’s Summit. Three drivers have been hurt in the shootings, but no one has been killed. The coach was saying that college athletes in the programs that produce revenue should receive more than a scholarship. He swore he believed this, that as many opportunities are given to scholarship athletes  exposure, no debt, tutors  an industry with enough money to pay coaches millions while the talent is prohibited from getting much more than room and board just didnt feel right. I figured Id test him. Its not supposed to happen this way, winning an NCAA title with a team of freshmen. But Kentucky has a chance to do just that Monday night when the Wildcats play Connecticut for the championship. The program magnifies one of the college basketballs biggest issues, something it is powerless to control.

For Money Smart Month, the Federal Reserve Bank will host a series of more than 200 seminars, workshops and other events in the metro area to get peoples attention about their bad money habits. On Sunday, financial planner Andres Gutierrez, aka El Machete, was the featured speaker at the Financial FunFest at Sporting Park. Michael Dorsey succeeds Fleury Yelvington who resigned last month.

She was severely depressed, and although she sought professional help, the worst happened. Never Have I Ever: My Life (So Far) Without a Date, 27-year-old Katie Heaney's frank and funny new memoir, makes a good case for staying single. Nara Schoenberg of the Chicago Tribune caught up with Heaney, now 27, dating a bit more and working as an editor at BuzzFeed, for a phone interview about life, love and the response to her first book. George Strait won his second entertainer of the year — 25 years after he won his first — and Miranda Lambert and Keith Urban teamed up to earn top honors Sunday night at a jam-packed Academy of Country Music Awards that had a little something for everyone. Mickey Rooney, the irrepressible actor of seemingly limitless skills who personified the all-American teenager in movie musicals with Judy Garland and dozens of other comedies and dramas, has died at 93. Rooney, once among the worlds top box-office stars, could sing, dance, play drums and do pratfalls and impersonations. He began his career at 15 months in his parents' vaudeville act and never really retired. Even before a weekend of late nights and frayed nerves, Kansas lawmakers were in the throes of agony. They needed to find $129 million to correct unconstitutional school funding inequities. But thanks to a self-inflicted budget crisis with no end in sight, the road to $129 million was paved only with brutal choices. What stands out in a visit to Guatemala are the hardworking, gracious people who endured a 36-year civil war claiming more than 200,000 lives and displacing even more before it ended in 1996.

Though the business still was under renovation, rap artists already had been recording there. The gunman apparently barged into the studio about 12:30 p.m. and shot Williams in the chest. Jones was shot next. The gunman aimed for a rap artist who was in the studio, but the rapper fled safely out the back door, ran to a nearby tire shop and called police. People familiar with the studio said they did not know Jones or why Jones was at the business.       | Christine Vendel, cvendel@kcstar.com Commenting disabled for this story.
