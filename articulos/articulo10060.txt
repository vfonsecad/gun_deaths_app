The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement that deputies responded to 8100 block of Cielito Drive about 9 a.m. following a “gunshot victim call.” Upon arriving on scene, deputies discovered a Hispanic couple. Both individuals had been shot. The woman was pronounced dead at the scene while the man was transported to an area hospital. His current condition was unknown. “Homicide detectives have since learned that both victims were involved in a relationship and had a child together,” the statement said. Murder suspect Giovanni Reyes is believed to have turned the gun on himself after shooting the mother of his child. (credit: LA County Sheriff’s Dept.) A friend of the couple’s told CBS2′s Art Barron that the child celebrated his second birthday just yesterday. The boy was not hurt. The friend also identified the male as 20-year-old Giovanni Reyes, a security guard. The woman was only identified as Melissa. The friend said the couple would fight like any other couple “but nothing serious.” The couple did not live together. The shooting reportedly took place at a home Reyes shared with his grandfather. Anyone with more information about the case was asked to call the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500.
