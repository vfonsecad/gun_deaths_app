He died a short time later, police said. Police were called 5310 N. 35th St. just before 12:30 a.m. Paramedics reported that Knowles had suffered two gunshot wounds to the back of head.Police reported no arrests after the shooting.Knowles was a shooting victim in August 2005, according to police. He told investigators at the time that two men robbed him at gunpoint near 30th and T Streets. But the officers who responded to the call found no gun shell casings or blood at the scene. The men stole $550, a credit card, a MasterCard prepaid card, a Western Union prepaid card and a Nebraska ID, Knowles told police.On Monday, police tape blocked off 35th Street, and authorities were still working the scene six hours after the shooting. A neighbor who lives a couple of houses to the north on 35th Street said she was awakened by her eight-year-old granddaughter, who said she heard gunshots.“It (gunfire) woke up my granddaughter, that's for sure,'' said Ellen States, 70, who lives with her daughter-in-law and five grandchildren.She described the neighborhood as safe, with her grandchildren often playing outside.“I wish they'd take the guns off the streets though,'' States added. “The only ones who need guns are the military and the police.''Another person also said the neighborhood was safe, even for a day-care operation about one block north of the homicide scene.“We've got no problems,'' said Tina Knight, 31, assistant director of Revolution of Love Academy Child Care Center. “We're blessed. We've got God watching us.''She said the children at her day-care center also play outside.“Everything's great here,'' she said. “We've got no concerns.'' Paramedics worked to resuscitate him on the way to the Nebraska Medical Center. He suffered two gunshot wounds to the back of his head, according to initial 911 dispatch reports. The shooting was called in at 12:28 a.m. Police reported no arrests after the shooting. Police tape blocked off 35th Street, and authorities were still working the scene six hours after the shooting. Detectives were spotted interviewing neighbors, shooting photos outside the crime scene and using their flashlights to search for evidence in 17-degree temperatures.Later Monday, after the police crime tape had been removed, reporters got a better look at the white, 1 1/2-story wood-frame house with a covered porch: an old tennis shoe had been left behind on the porch, a satellite dish was mounted on the south side of the roof and a sign on a chain-link fence read “Posted, No Trespassing, Keep Out.''A neighbor who lives a couple of houses to the north on 35th Street said Monday that she was awakened by her eight-year-old granddaughter, who said she heard gunshots.“It (gunfire) woke up my granddaughter, that's for sure,'' said Ellen States, 70, who lives with her daughter-in-law and five grandchildren.She described the neighborhood at 35th and Fort Streets as safe, with her grandchildren often playing outside.“I wish they'd take the guns off the streets,'' States added. “The only ones who need guns are the military and the police.''Another person also said the neighborhood was safe, even for a day-care operation about one block north of the homicide scene.“We've got no problems,'' said Tina Knight, 31, assistant director of Revolution of Love Academy Child Care Center. “We're blessed.
