(WTVR) – The Salem Police Department is investigating the death of Powhatan County School Board member Vernon Poe. “Vernon Poe of Powhatan was the subject of the ‘shot fired’ 911 call our Police Department received on Sunday evening,” Salem Police Communications Director Mike Stevens confirmed via email. “Mr. Poe was pronounced dead at the scene when our officers arrived at the McDonald’s parking lot on the corner of Goodwin Avenue West Main Street in Salem.” Stevens added police were awaiting a final ruling from the medical examiner’s office to determine the circumstances surrounding Poe’s death. Poe had served on the Powhatan School Board since his election in 2011. He was also a detective for the Powhatan County Sheriff’s Office, according to Michele Wilson with Powhatan County Schools. The school board has 45 days to fill Poe’s seat.  A special election would likely happen in February, Wilson added. Funeral services are scheduled for Thursday, 11 a.m., in the Bethesda Church of God, in Powhatan, according to Poe’s obituary.
