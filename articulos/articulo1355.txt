1 An 18-year-old man died when he put a gun to his head to show how safe it was and the weapon fired, killing him, according to the St. Petersburg police. Alexander Xavier Shaw, of 733 71 Ave. N., died about 6:30 p.m. Wednesday as he was showing the weapon to family and friends, police said. Police were called to the home to investigate a shooting and they found Shaw behind the house with a gunshot wound to the head. He was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. Witness told officers that Shaw, his uncle, grandparents and some friends were on the back patio talking when he showed them a .38-caliber revolver, police said. Shaw told them that he kept one round out of the firing chamber to prevent an accidental shooting, according to police. Witnesses then said Shaw tried to prove the gun was safe by placing it to his head and pulling the trigger, which is when the gun fired, fatally wounding him, police said. The case is still under investigation by homicide detectives and the Medical Examiner's Office. Alexander Shaw's father, Richard Shaw, was shot to death June 18 in a home invasion robbery at 7014 Orpine Drive N., police said. A co-defendant, Charles C. Stone, 28, was charged on Aug. 10.
