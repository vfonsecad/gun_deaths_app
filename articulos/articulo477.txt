1 Update on Jan. 27 at 12:13 p.m. by Melissa Repko: The Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office has identified the man who died after a bar fight at Club Extasis as John Martin Hargrove, 50. His next-of-kin has been notified. His address is not known, and the Medical Examiner’s Office has not yet determined the cause of death. Update on Jan. 26 at 2:39 p.m: Dallas police have issued an arrest warrant in one of the two slayings. Federico Prado, 23, is wanted on suspicion of murder in the death of a man during a bar fight at Club Extasis on Grand Avenue, according to police records. A witness told police that Prado kicked the victim in the head several times while he was on the ground. “The complainant did not move after the suspect kicked him and an ambulance was called,” police records state. “Patrons at the club attempted life saving techniques until Dallas Fire Rescue arrived.” Officers who responded to the scene found the victim on the club’s dance floor. Original item posted at 9:57 a.m.: Dallas police homicide detectives were busy dealing with two unrelated slayings that occurred within hours of each other in different parts of the city. Police have not reported making arrests in either slaying. The first slaying occurred about 8 p.m. Friday in a strip mall parking lot in the 9700 block of Forest Lane in Far Northeast Dallas. According to police, officers who responded to a report of a shooting found 19-year-old Hector Javier Dominguez lying in a strip mall parking lot. Dominguez had been shot several times and died at the scene. Police have not determined a motive for the slaying. About 3 a.m. today, Dallas police officers were called to a disturbance at a bar in the 5400 block of East Grand Avenue in Old East Dallas. Inside the bar, police found an unconscious man, who had been beaten by several suspects with a chair, a pool stick and kicked in the head. The man was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. Authorities say 27-year-old Paris Luh was also injured during the bar fight. He suffered bruises, scratches and a large gash on the right side of his head. A police report said police that he did not recall how the injuries occurred. On Luh’s Facebook page, he posted pictures of his battered and bruised face. Bandages covered his face. He also said that police had questioned him about the manâs death and he indicated that he had performed CPR on someone at the bar, but did not say on whom. Luh’s report was listed as an injured person report. I have asked Dallas police officials to clarify why it was entered as an injured person report rather than as an aggravated assault. (Note: The report was later reclassified as an aggravated assault.) You can follow me on Twitter at @tanyaeiserer.
