1 1 Shreveport Police are investigating a deadly shooting in west Shreveport early Saturday morning that happened during an apparent home invasion. Police were called to a home in the 3800 block of Murvon Street around 3:30 a.m. for a report of a shooting. They arrived to find a man who had been shot in the upper body. The man, identified as 24-year-old Malcom Fuller, was taken to LSU Health Shreveport, where he later died. Police say the occupants and potential witnesses have been questioned, and initial information suggests that a man dressed in all dark clothing, wearing a cover over his face, forced his way into the home armed with two handguns. Police were told once the man entered the home, he demanded the occupants hand over money. It was alleged during this time a person inside the home observed what was taking place and subsequently engaged Fuller, firing multiple times. Police say the investigation is still in the early stages, and efforts to gather additional details surrounding the shooting and determine the possibility of charges are still under way.
