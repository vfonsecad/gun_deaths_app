She told police her ex-husband, identified later by authorities as Guadalupe Aguilar, was following her, in violation of an order of protection, Camden said.    The woman told police she had been at a store near 51st and Kedzie when she ran intoAguilar, authorities said.    He was “stalking her, saw her at the store . . . and had a large butcher knife tucked in the back of his pants,” Camden said.     Aguilar then followed her home, but he appeared to have left after police were called, Camden said.    But instead of leaving the area, Aguilar apparently parked a block away and snuck into her backyard, where he was waiting with the knife, Camden said.    Meanwhile, officers in front of the home asked the woman if she had a copy of the order of protection. She went to retrieve the document, walking around the house to enter through a rear door.   That’s when they heard her scream, Camden said.    When officers ran to the gangway, they saw Aguilar on top of the woman, stabbing her with a butcher knife with a 12-inch blade, police and Camden said.   They are “about three feet away from him, he sees them, jumps up and starts coming at the officers with the butcher knife in hand,” Camden said.    One of the officers drew a gun and shot the man, Chicago Police said in the statement. The 29-year-old man died from his wounds at the scene, authorities said.   The woman was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital with several stab wounds, but her injuries were not thought to be life-threatening, Camden said.   The officers were not injured and a weapon was recovered from the scene, police said.    The Independent Police Review Authority, which reviews all police-involved shootings, is investigating.
