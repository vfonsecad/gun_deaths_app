1 1 Staff ReportNewsWest 9 BIG SPRING - A teenager in Big Spring has been formally charged for the murder of his girlfriend. 19-year-old Dakota Anguiano was indicted for killing 17-year-old Abigail Valencia. You'll remember he was locked up back in September after taking the young mother to the hospital with a gunshot wound. Valencia died from that injury a few days later. According to police, Anguiano had lied to them about what had happened at first. But his story didn't add up and authorities found out that he had shot her at a home in the 1300 block of Tucson. Another man, David Westbrook, was also arrested in September for tampering with evidence. While police have no motive to the shooting, they believe the couple's daughter may have seen it happen.
