1 1          A man shot just before midnight Wednesday died Thursday afternoon, and police are looking for a suspect in the killing. At 11:47 p.m. Wednesday, someone called Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers to Stonehenge Lane near Capps Hill Mine Road in northwest Charlotte in reference to gunshots that were fired.  Officers couldnât find anyone who had been shot. But a short time later, they were notified that a man who had been shot was located two miles away on Beatties Ford Road near Interstate 85.  When they got there, they found Bob David Pate, 25, gravely injured. He was taken to Carolinas Medical Center, but died around 3 p.m. Thursday.  Police havenât released a suspectâs name, or said what they believe led up to the shooting.  In a press release, they said they canvassed the neighborhood to speak with witnesses and believe Pate knew the person who shot him, although officers havenât said why they believe that.
