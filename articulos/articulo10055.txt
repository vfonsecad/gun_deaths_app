1 1 SALISBURY â Chiquita Chunn peered out of her window at a large group after waking to what she thought sounded like gunfire Sunday morning. Through the blinds of her first-floor apartment, Chunn watched a tall figure with dreadlocks point a gun at a man in the group and fire another three to four shots, she said. âA couple seconds later, there were about four shots again,ââChunn recalled. One man was killed in Sunday morningâs shooting at Clancy Hills Apartments which erupted about 4:30 a.m., police said. Another remained in hospital care, but is expected to survive. No charges have been filed in the shooting. Authorities said 27-year-old Eric Maurice Feamster was taken to Novant Health Rowan Medical Center with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest. He later died of his injuries. Salisbury Police Officer Chris Hamm was off-duty and working security at the complex when he heard gunshots on the other side of the neighborhood, police said. Hamm found 25-year-old Tyson Gaymon lying in a breezeway that split the 104 building near Clancy Street and Statesville Boulevard. Feamster was found in an adjoining apartment. Hamm called for EMS and additional officers. Gaymon remained at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center Sunday afternoon. According to investigators, Gaymon was conscious immediately after the shooting, but refused to answer officersâ questions about the incident. Investigators were still on the scene Sunday afternoon as crime scene technicians searched for evidence in the slaying. Police entered a neighboring apartment at 1:40 p.m., and detectives began searching for clues. The focus of the investigation was at building 104. Outside the apartment, few reminders of the morning terror remained. Remnants of yellow crime tape that had been hastily tied and later cut from two trees in the front of the complex remained. A Honda Accord in front of the complex sported a large bullet hole to the front right corner. Another bullet hole was found in the vinyl paneling around Chunnâs window. âIt didnât go through,ââChunn said, looking at the small hole in the off-white molding. But that didnât stop her thinking what could have been. âThe shots woke my daughter up,â she said. âShe was walking around right there.â Several residents said they recognized the names of the victims, but said they didnât see or hear anything during the night. Others said they simply woke Sunday morning to a parking lot full of officers. Chunn said she had been awake and even spent some time outside with a group, which included Gaymon, earlier that evening. The dispute wasnât between Gaymon and Feamster, she said. They were friends,ââChunn said. As investigators walked in and out of two adjoining apartments opposite of Chunnâs  Sunday, Chunn said a large group had been congregating around the two residences during the night.
