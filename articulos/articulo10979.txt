Officers found Victoria Neely, 27, of Lafayette, dead from a gunshot wound when responding to a report of burglary at an apartment in the 1300 block of West University Avenue a t 11:10 p.m. Wednesday, Lafayette police said. Police received a tip early Thursday that a person of interest in the investigation was at a home at Lamar and Cleveland streets and arrived there to find David Brannon, 38, dead from what detectives believe was a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police spokesman Cpl. Nicole Benoit said Friday. The Police Department is not commenting at this time on whether Brannon is suspected of killing Neely, Benoit said, but police said in a news release that “detectives believe the two incidents are related.” Brannon and Neely were married March 14, but Neely had filed for divorce in July, writing in the divorce petition that the two had been separated since June 5, according to court records. A few years before the marriage, Brannon had been arrested on a domestic abuse battery charge for allegedly striking Neely in August 2010 while the two were living together in Duson, according to court records. Brannon pleaded no contest in September 2011 to reduced charges of simple battery and resisting arrest and was sentenced to one year unsupervised probation, according to court records. Faith House, a domestic violence shelter and support organization in Lafayette, has organized a memorial for Neely at 6 p.m. Saturday at Parc Sans Souci in Lafayette, said Kristen Boutte, with Faith House. Boutte said the organization’s confidentiality code prevents her from discussing whether Neely had sought assistance from Faith House. Send a letter to the editor to voice your opinion.
