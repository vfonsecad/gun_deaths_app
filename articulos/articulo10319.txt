The victim, identified as a man in his early 30s, was waiting with another person about 12:45 a.m. at the Park View Place Estates at 6226 Barnes Road South when the pair was approached by three men. “A conversation ensued and after that conversation, gunshots rang out,” Sgt. T.K. Waters said. The victim was transported to UF Health Jacksonville, but was pronounced deceased. Police would not speculate on a motive for the shooting or say with whom the victim was waiting. Anyone with information can call the Sheriff’s Office at (904) 630-0500 or CrimeStoppers at (888) 277-8477 (TIPS). clifford.davis@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4207 PREV 1 man shot in Grand Park; Myrtle Avenue erupts in gunfire Monday night NEXT Man possibly injured after multiple shots fired on Jacksonville's DePaul Drive please read our user agreement and privacy policy before posting Seems like anyone out after sun down is subject to getting shot. Maybe a curfew needs to be put into place for any one under the age of 40. Since the police won't speculate on why this shooting occured; I will: it is drug and/or gang related. In vintage television ads Green Cove Springs was given the moniker: "Little Detroit." Apparently Jacksonville is "Little Detroit." Crime, poverty, rampant bedlam, Jacksonville has a few problems. If the elected officials have no solutions for these blights on the cityscape, who does? As long as the government keeps paying people to breed this will only get worse. The concern for other human beings does not seem to exist, from many posters or the criminals. I am concerned about the deaths, from violence, in the community. As well as the unsafe roadways in this community. The lack of regard for each other extents to the roadways in this community. Northeast Florida has a great number of vehicular deaths, that not a word is expressed towards. That lack of concern makes the ridiculous comments, about the crime violence, that much more ridiculous. Richardman - big difference - Roadways are safe if you obey the laws and regulations -  However two guys standing in a parking lot approached by three black males (as reported on Channel 12 news) one is shot and killed - short of barracading yourself in your house, how do you keep from becomming a victim?   Bet 'cha dime to donuts these suspects are welfare babies that have never had to work for anything in their lives.......  Liberals huh, yeah...Good God... What are they good for ? Absolutely Nothing...Say it again  It's been said that Corrine is as stupid as she is ugly. Not True.  She's as ugly as she is stupid. I can't get all worked up over thugs killing each other. Many times the " victims " have a long criminal history.   " Your stereotype thanks you for your support!" Whatever helps you sleep at night Ricardman... Police won't speculate on a motive, but I will, drugs! Legalize drugs and the violence would probably go down.  Maybe they will all overdose!!. Drummerboyofjax Homicide Count facts for those of you who haven't seen this. At 8.44 avg. per month = 101 projected for this year. I would like to see where the majority of homicides are in our city and the ratio of black vs. white and why the Mayor and the Sherriff are not concentrating on those areas with more Police presence. 2013 HOMICIDE COUNT: 55 (Through 7/16) 2012 Homicide Count: 108 2011 Homicide Count: 86 2010 Homicide Count: 99 2009 Homicide Count: 113 2008 Homicide Count: 144 2007 Homicide Count: 152 2006 Homicide Count: 137 The City of Jacksonville really needs to get a handle on all the violent crime that is occurring. I wonder how many violent crimes have occurred since Jan 1, 2013. Most of the time the paper only reports the crimes that result in homicide. I bet the violent crime numbers are much higher.  Recently, I visited New York City and I honestly felt safer walking down the street there than I do here in good ole Jacksonville. Maybe we should do a little research on how NYPD got control of their high crime rates. One program that I know they have implemented is the Stop, Question and Frisk program. I realize that this is a controversial program but sometimes controversial programs are needed in order to get things safe again.  Immediately people will start shouting that you can't profile but the NYPD publishes a report that shows how they determine who to stop.  http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/analysis_and_planning/stop_question_an... Until Jacksonville addresses the REAL issues in this community, we will never get to the "next level". One thing I know for sure, you can't do it on the cheap. Annie1 "Murder in Jacksonville" - a continuing reality series... Analogies and comparisons with Detroit continue. It wasn't Detroit's current budget woes which brought that city down to where it is, it was crime, drugs, violence, and socio-cultural and civic decline. Workers from a thriving black middle class joined their white coworkers in leaving that city. Jacksonville's politicians, civic leaders, and media need to put the same kind of aggressive effort into addressing this endemic problem as the Local Government Study Commission put into studying the defects of local government which resulted in a Grand Jury and indictments, and eventually into consolidation. The loss of business, good jobs, and upscale, affluent workers will cause increasing problems for Jacksonville. The resulting budget problems will be an effect, rather than a cause. sandbiskit WOKV news said the victim was white and the killers were black.  Hasn't anyone else noticed a rise in black on white shootings since the Trayvon decision came down?  How do we organize nationwide marches...who are OUR "Al" and "Jesse" ?  Why are we ignoring this instead of organizing our community? Most of the people that are getting shot and killed tend to bring it on themselves.
