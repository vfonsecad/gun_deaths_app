Choose the custom package best suited for you! A South Side man was shot multiple times this afternoon during what police say might have been a robbery at his apartment. The 30-year-old victim died at Grant Medical Center shortly after the shooting at 1200 Linwood Ave. His identity was not released tonight as police attempted to contact his relatives, who might live outside the country, Columbus Police Sgt. Dana Norman said. Witnesses reported hearing men arguing inside the apartment before several shots were fired just after 4:30 p.m., Norman said. Three men were seen leaving the apartment. The man’s body was found on the porch. No suspects were in custody tonight, and Norman had no descriptions of the men or the vehicle they were driving. The man’s landlord, who did not want to be identified, said his tenant was an easygoing Jamaican native who paid his rent on time and never caused trouble during his year and a half living on Linwood. The landlord had been called to the scene by a tenant of another unit in the building who reported hearing five gunshots at the man’s apartment. lkurtzman@dispatch.com @LoriKurtzman Most Popular Most Shared Dispatch Media Group
