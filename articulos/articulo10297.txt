The victim, 35-year-old Mandell V. Glover, was dead when officers arrived at the scene in the 5100 block of Woodbrier Street, according to Richland County Sheriff's Department spokesman Curtis Wilson said. He died from complications due to a gunshot wound to the head, Richland County Coroner Gary Watts said Tuesday.  A second person, also unidentified, was transported to a local hospital for gunshot wounds. That victim's condition is unknown at this time. Details were limited Monday night, but Wilson said two groups with two people each got into an altercation at the location, near Monticello Road, just after 9 p.m. The fight turned violent, and several gunshots were fired.  Investigators are now trying to follow up leads and are determining who is responsible for the shooting.
