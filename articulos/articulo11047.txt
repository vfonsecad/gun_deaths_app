1 1 Five suspects were arrested in connection to a murder at a Nashville apartment complex overnight, and police said it started out with a big plan to allegedly rob at least two victims. According to Metro Police, Anastacio Lopez Taperia, 21, was killed in the parking lot of the Horizon Park Apartments on Packard Drive Saturday morning. In a report, police said Taperia and his friends met Candice Young, 23, of Antioch and Robin Griggs, 33, of Smyrna at a bar on Apache Trail. The women then lured Taperia and his friends back to their home. When the group arrived, three men emerged and tried to rob the men. According to police, Taperia was shot; his friend drove him to another parking lot nearby and called police.   Later, a Metro Police supervisor spotted a car that matched the suspects' and pulled the driver over during a traffic stop. Young, Grigg, and three other men were inside. Police said one of the suspect's admitted to being involved in the homicide. Police arrested the two women, Derek Lance, 29, of Smyrna; Stanley Hawkins, 26, of Clarksville; and Ronnie Palmer, 32, of Nashville. All five are charged with murder.  Lance is being held on a $2 million bond; the other four defendants are being held on a $1.5 million bond each. Detectives believe the robbery scenario had been planned.
