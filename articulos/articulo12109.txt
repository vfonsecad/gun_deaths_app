Contact Customer Service by email    or call 800-338-8801 One man was killed in a shooting resulting from a drug deal gone bad Tuesday night in Hillyard, Spokane police said. Detectives have questioned the alleged shooter and are investigating his claims of self-defense, said Major Crimes Lt. Mark Griffiths. Both men in the incident were armed. The shooter also was injured in the incident. Police responded to the report of gunfire at 2418 E. Empire Ave. just before midnight and found the victim with at least one gunshot wound. Multiple witnesses said the man was shot twice, police said. Medical personnel attempted CPR on the victim, but he died at the scene, a news release from the Spokane Police Department said. The shooter was driven away from the scene and picked up at a residence on Sinto Avenue, Griffiths said. He was questioned by detectives and released because police did not have probable cause to detain him for murder or manslaughter. Griffiths declined to say what kind of drugs were involved in the incident, which took place both inside and outside the residence on Empire Avenue. Griffiths said the suspected shooter is cooperating with law enforcement. An autopsy is scheduled for today.
