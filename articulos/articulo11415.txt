1 1 (Photo Credit: KDKA) BEAVER FALLS (KDKA) â Police are looking for a suspect after an overnight shooting left one man dead and another injured outside of a troubled nightspot in Beaver County. âThey said he was just standing outside, waiting for the car when he got shot,â said Gloria Wall, the victimâs mother. Wall is now waiting for answers. Her son, 45-year-old Jerome Goosby, was shot and killed around 3 a.m. outside the Elks Club on 7th Avenue in Beaver Falls. Police are looking for the gunman who fired shots at Goosby and another man, identified as Walter Pickens. He was shot in the leg, Goosby died from a bullet wound in the chest. âI have no idea why. I wish knew,â said Wall. âI donât know why. It’s justâ¦ I just believe it’s circumstances, you know, something Iâm going to have to deal with.â Police were back at the Elks Club Saturday afternoon hoping to talk to the manager. The club had only been open for a few weeks after getting its liquor license back. Sources believe Goosby might have been an innocent bystander killed by a bullet meant for someone else. His mother canât understand why anyone would shoot him. âA lot of people in Beaver Falls knew him, and they liked him,â said Wall. âThey thought he was the best person. They truly did like him.â Wallâs mother blames her son’s death on the easy availability of guns. âIt’s just way out of control, and it seems like, to me, the younger they are the worse it is,â she said. âIt’s like I said, it’s out of control. It’s senseless.â Police are hoping tape from a video surveillance camera will help identify a suspect. Wall has this question for the man who shot her son. âYou took my babyâs life, why?â she said. âBasically, I want to know why.â Several people told KDKAâs Bob Allen off camera, Beaver Falls is not a big town and people know who shot and killed Goosby. They believe it’s just a matter of time before police make and arrest.
