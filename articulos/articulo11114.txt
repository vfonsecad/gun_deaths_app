A short time later, a car crashed and overturned near the intersection of Martin Luther King Jr. and Poole Road. Multiple people reportedly fled from the crash on foot, and responding officers found a man dead from gunshot wounds inside. His name was not released. "While the vehicle involved the crash is believed to have had a relationship to the shots-fired call, detectives have not yet made final determinations concerning the circumstances involved in the incidents or the wound sustained by the male located inside the crashed vehicle," Raleigh police spokeswoman Laura Hourigan said in a news release. Carlton Barnes said he was in the Cook-Out parking lot when the gunfire erupted. "It was scary, a scary situation," Barnes said. "Something I hope I never get in again." Witnesses said the gunman was sitting on a railing outside the restaurant when an employee asked him to move his car. He left for a short time before returning and firing shots. "After that, I don't know what happened because I ran," Barnes said. Demetrius Smith said he saw a PT Cruiser race from the scene before crashing down the road. Both incidents remain under investigation. Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 919-834-4357 or visit www.raleighcrimestoppers.org to report a tip by text or email. Crime Stoppers pays cash rewards for tips that help solve cases and callers can remain confidential.
