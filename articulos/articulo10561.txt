(Lee Talbert/Johnson City Press)   A man and woman found dead in their home in the Leesburg community of west Jonesborough on Friday were identified Saturday night by the Washington County Sheriff’s Office. A WCSO news release said James Dennis, 39, and Amy Dennis, 28, 113 Smith Lane, were identified as the victims of a murder-suicide.  Washington County Sheriff Ed Graybeal said Friday the incident reportedly resulted from marital problems between the two victims. Police believe James Dennis killed Amy Dennis, then killed himself. WCSO deputies were called to the residence around 2 p.m., after a neighbor called in a welfare check. Graybeal said when deputies arrived they noticed a strong odor and the presence of insects, giving them reason to enter the residence, where they located two bodies. WCSO deputies believed the double shooting to have taken place Wednesday. Graybeal said .40-caliber bullets were also taken from the scene. The bodies were transported to the James H. Quillen College of Medicine for an autopsy. According to the news release, the investigation is ongoing. Click Here To View Mug Shot Gallery
