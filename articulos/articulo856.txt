1 King County sheriff's deputies said a body was found near the man's truck, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, though he hasn't been positively identified as the suspect in the woman's shooting, KIRO-TV, Seattle said. The suspect, identified as Dion Fisher, crashed his truck through his ex-wife's front window at 3:30 a.m. and fired five shots, striking the woman once in the hand, police said. She was taken to a hospital for treatment. Two of the children escaped through a back door and ran to a neighbor's house to call 911. The third child hid inside the home. Fisher fled the scene in his truck and evaded capture. Police said they've located the truck and found the body nearby.
