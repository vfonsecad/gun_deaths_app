1 1 Police search for suspects who shot man inside car Homicide detectives are investigating after a man was fatally shot Saturday inside of his vehicle. The family identified the victim as 33-year-old Maykel Dublon. Miami-Dade police said the shooting happened at 2 p.m. Saturday in the 16400 block of Northeast 5th Avenue. Investigators said the man was sitting in his gold car when he was approached by four to five suspects, who subsequently shot and killed him. Police said the suspects then drove away in a white four-door vehicle. Neighbors say they heard the gunshots, but didn't see the suspects. Dublon's white rear lights were on, indicating that he may have put his car into reverse to try and get away. He was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said. The motive of the shooting is still unknown. The victim's brother-in-law, Jeffrey Ramirez, spoke with Local 10's Jeff Weinsier. "He didn't deserve this. He was just a humble man, he didn't mess with anybody - trying to lookout for whoever he could," said Ramirez. Police have not released any further detail. Those with information about this shooting are asked to call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS. Watch Local 10 News and refresh Local10.com for updates on this story.
