The shooting happened at about 8 p.m. in the 3100 block of Daniel Drive. Deputies say they found 19-year-old Truy Jones with multiple gunshot wounds lying on the lawn in front of a home. He was pronounced dead on the scene. A man who moved to St. Bernard Parish two months ago from Plaquemines Parish, 18-year-old Grid Reddick, was booked Wednesday evening with second-degree murder. Reddick has no previous criminal record, according to Sheriff James Pohlmann. Sheriff Pohlmann said he wouldn't go into a possible motive or other details of the investigation at this time. This was the third murder of the year in St. Bernard Parish.   Next article                     Yenni re-elected Kenner mayor in landslide victory, two council races head to runoff                   Search ©2014 WWL-TV, Inc., A Gannett Company.
