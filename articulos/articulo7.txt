State police have determined the death of an Evans City man was found inside an auto-repair shop in Forward Township late Friday evening was homicide. Troopers said an acquaintance discovered the body of 45-year-old Robert Charles Gaurrich, of Brownsdale Road, at Bob's Trucks & Auto Repair Inc., located at 1657 Evans City Road, at about 11:20 p.m. Gaurrich, the owner of the auto body repair shop, died of a gunshot wound to the chest, according to an autopsy performed by the Butler County coroner Saturday afternoon. The coroner's office has ruled the death to be a homicide. State police spokesman Trooper Dan Kesten said the friend who stopped by the auto repair shop was worried about Gaurrich after he was unable to get in contact with him Friday. When he got to the shop, he found Gaurrichâs body and immediately called police, Kesten said. âPeople were expecting him to return home,â Kesten said of Gaurrich. Kesten said investigators have been inside building gathering evidence since midnight. Detectives were interviewing people to obtain more information Saturday, Kesten said. He said Gaurrich was the only person inside the building when troopers arrived at the garage Friday. Because of the ongoing investigation, authorities said they will not release more details at this time.
