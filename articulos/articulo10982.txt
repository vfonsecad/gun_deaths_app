Charlie Wilson III, 26, remains on active duty as the GBI investigates his alleged involvement in the death of Tameda Ferguson, 30, and her 8  1/2-month-old fetus. According to a news release from the GBI, Wilson was arrested Aug. 31 when he was spotted driving through Tift County. He was charged with one count of murder and one count of feticide. Wilson is being held in the Tift County jail, awaiting transfer to Terrell County. A news release from Robins states Wilson has been in the Air Force since April 2006 and was assigned to the 461st Aircraft Maintenance Squadron in October 2006. Base officials are cooperating with civilian authorities in the investigation, the release states. Ferguson was found shot in her Dawson home Aug. 29 and had apparently suffered from a gunshot wound, according to the GBI. Dawson, the county seat of Terrell County, is in southwest Georgia. The investigation (led) to a Charlie Wilson, a known associate of Ms. Ferguson, the release states. Kim Baker, special agent in charge at the GBIs Sylvester office, said Wilson and Ferguson were involved and had an ongoing relationship. She declined to say whether the baby was Wilsons.
