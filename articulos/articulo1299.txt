Officers shot Jimmy L. Hamlin Jr., 44, after he brandished a rifle during a traffic stop, according to a release from the West Virginia State Police. According to the release, Hamlin was from Kathleen but had recently been living in Greenbrier County, W. Va. At about 4:15 p.m. Monday, Lewisburg, W. Va., police officers were dispatched to be on a lookout for a vehicle driven by Hamlin following a domestic dispute. It was reported he had been drinking and was armed. When Lewisburg officers pulled the vehicle over along U.S. 219 at the Interstate 64 intersection, they saw Hamlin with a rifle, and he failed to comply with police orders, the release stated. He got out of the vehicle with the rifle and an armed stand-off began for several minutes. Meanwhile additional officers from the West Virginia State Police, Greenbrier County Sheriffs Office, and Alderson and Ronceverte police departments arrived on the scene. When Hamlin made a hostile action with the gun, the release stated, officers fired and struck him several times. He was pronounced dead at Greenbrier Valley Medical Center. The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure. The West Virginia State Police is investigating the incident.
