1 1   			 52° F 11:23 a.m. EDT, October 11, 2013 A man was shot and killed on Baltimore's Howard Park neighborhood early Friday morning, breaking a streak of more than 10 days without a homicide in the city. Officers discovered a man suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest when they responded to a shooting call in the 5500 block of Gwynn Oak Ave. around 12:15 a.m. The man was pronounced dead after being taken to a nearby hospital.  Baltimore Police are investigating the shooting, and have not yet contacted the man's family members about the incident.  There had not been a homicide in Baltimore since Sept. 30, a quiet stretch in a city that has averaged roughly two killings every three days. Not only were there no homicides, but the homicide count for the year went down by one during the stretch — after police and prosecutors determined that the Sept. 14 killing of Neal Hunt, 33, was committed in self-defense, it was removed from the count of killings.  jfenton@baltsun.com Twitter.com/justin_fenton Copyright © 2014, The Baltimore Sun  The Baltimore Sun, 501 N.
