1 1 ROSEBURG, Ore. - A 91-year-old man died from a self-inflicted gunshot late Thursday evening after he walked into a gun shop, asked to see a handgun and shot himself in the head the previous morning, police said. An employee at the Roseburg Gun Shop reported a single shot was fired inside the store just after 8 a.m. Wednesday. The employee told police that a customer, later identified as Charles Hanson, 91 of Roseburg, had come in and asked to look at a handgun. The clerk handed Hanson an unloaded firearm. The employee turned away for a moment and reported hearing the gunshot. He ran from the building and called police. Officers set up a perimeter around the Diamond Lake Boulevard business and evacuated employees from nearby stores. Hanson came out of the store at around 8:17 a.m., covered in blood. Police detained him, and he was taken to the hospital for treatment. Officials reported that Hanson died from his injury at the Riverbend Medical Center in Springfield late Thursday afternoon. The incident is under investigation, but police said Hanson appeared to have a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.  http://youtu.be/o9mJ82x_l-E   Getting old sucks, but I don't know that I would go to that extreme.   How did he get the bullet? Was he carrying it with him? Its just sad. I feel bad for both him and the shop owner.  @DikweedÃÂ It is as simple as that...91... he was ready to go...sad that he did it at the expense of someone elses mental health!
