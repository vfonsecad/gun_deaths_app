LACIE PIERSON                 	HUNTINGTON — A man shot Wednesday night at an apartment complex near Huntington has died, according to authorities.  	West Virginia State Police Sgt. Greg Losh confirmed Thursday morning the victim, identified as 25-year-old Christopher Carter, died overnight. He had received three gunshot wounds, Losh confirmed.  	No arrest was immeditely reported.  	The incident was first reported at about 8:45 p.m. at Forest Bluff Apartments. Cabell County Sheriff Tom McComas said the victim was transported to St. Mary’s Medical Center with multiple gunshot wounds, including at least one to his chest.  	Witnesses on the scene said the man was not a resident of the complex.  	West Virginia State Police Sgt. R.D. Perry said investigators with the sheriff’s office and the state police were conducting the preliminary stages of the investigation of the scene at 10 p.m. Wednesday.  	The original call was for a possible shooting at the complex, which was reported to authorities by a neighbor at the apartment, Perry said.  	When he and other officers arrived on scene they found multiple neighbors tending to the man, Perry said. Several neighbors told police they heard the gunshots shortly before hearing the victim screaming for help.  	There was no information to indicate what led to the shooting Wednesday, and Perry said witness statements were still being collected. No suspect information is available at this time.  	While the investigation is pending, Perry said the situation could have been much more grave.  	“It’s very unfortunate when something like this happens,” Perry said. “It’s unfortunate for the victim, and it’s unfortunate for everyone here. When there’s any kind of shooting in an area like this, it’s a cause for concern because there’s always a chance one of those bullets can go through the window of one of these apartments and hit a child or another innocent person.”  	Progress sections published March 9.
