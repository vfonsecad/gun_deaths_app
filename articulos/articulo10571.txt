1 1 Clarksville police found a body in the parking lot of one of the city's high schools on Thursday morning. Police were dispatched to Northwest High School just before 2 a.m. when the body of 38-year-old Daniel Lamar Reed was found. Clarksville police spokesman Sgt. Charles Gill said it wasn't known if the shooting happened there or elsewhere. "I had four children graduate high school over there," said the Rev. Barry Reaves, a neighbor of Northwest High. "We're up in the air, and we're concerned because of the children over there." "We are positive this is not relating to any students or staff at Northwest High School or any other high school in the Clarksville Montgomery County area," said Gill. Buses and classes were rerouted this morning to ensure students would not see the crime scene. "Children were not in harm's way whatsoever," said Elise Shelton of the Clarksville Montgomery County school system. "This incident happened long before anybody came onto campus this morning. We found out about it and were able to put things in place to protect the students from that." Police are asking for any information on where Reed may have been before 2 this morning. "When something like this happens, it makes you a little leery," said Reaves. "Before, we could leave the doors unlocked. Now you want to lock your doors because you don't know what's going to happen." School officials said they chose not to close Northwest High because they felt the investigation was taking place far enough away from where the classes would be held. School counselors were available for students.  Copyright 2013 WSMV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.
