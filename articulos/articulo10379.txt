1 1 HAMMOND | A 23-year-old East Chicago man was shot and killed in an apparent road rage incident Thursday night in Hammond. Montrell Moss, 23, of the 3800 block of Butternut Street in East Chicago, was pronounced dead at 8:50Â p.m. in the emergency room of Franciscan St. Margaret Health hospital in Hammond, according to a report from the Lake County coroner's office. The cause of death was listed as a gunshot wound suffered in an apparent homicide in the 1000 block of Indianapolis Boulevard. Police Chief Brian Miller said Moss was driving a light blue Buick LeSabre northbound on Indianapolis Boulevard alongsideÂ a gold Chevrolet Venture van prior to the fatal shooting. A witness in Moss' vehicle told police MossÂ threw a cup full of water from a fast-food restaurant out of the vehicle, striking the van. The 61-year-old driver of the van fired a single shot from a 9 mm handgun, striking Moss in the left side of the neck and fled the scene, Miller said. Officers responded to the scene and while the witness in Moss' car was speaking to them, pointed toÂ a passing vehicle and said, "That's the van. That's the man." Officers stopped the van and found the weapon and a shell casing inside, Miller said. Investigators plan to present murder charges against the driver of the van to the Lake County prosecutor's office Saturday morning. Miller asked anyone with information about the shooting to contact Detective Sgt. Sean Ford or Detective Sgt. Ken Stump at (219) 852-2906. Copyright 2014 nwitimes.com. All rights reserved.
