A 26-year-old man was shot dead in Kingsessing Wednesday night. Police were called to 57th Street and Florence Avenue at 7:18 p.m. and found Raheem Williams, 26, of Beaumont Avenue near 56th, lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to the left side of his torso, Chief Inspector Scott Small said. Medics took Williams to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, where he died at 7:44 p.m. Small said police found three spent .22-caliber shell casings on Beaumont Avenue near 57th Street, about a block from where Williams ran to and collapsed. Police said a pool of blood and some cash marked the spot where Williams fell at the corner. A fight may have led to the shooting, according to police, and officers were looking for a man on a bike seen leaving the scene who may have been connected.Â  Investigators were checking area surveillance cameras for any footage of the shooter and interviewing witnesses late Wednesday. The homicide remains under investigation.Â  Tipsters can call homicide detectives at (215) 686-3334 or -3335.
