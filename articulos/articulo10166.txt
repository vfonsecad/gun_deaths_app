Novi police responded to the Extended Stay AmericaÂ hotel on Haggerty Road, just north of 8Â Mile Road near I-275, around 4:30 a.m. Thursday after receiving reports that a single gunshot was heard. Police say the gunshot came from a room on the first floor. Guests in the surrounding rooms were evacuated. Reporting live from the scene, WWJ’s Ron Dewey said he observed armed SWAT team members rush into the hotel. Several police cars blocked theÂ hotel’sÂ driveway and a handful of hotel guests were seen milling about theÂ entranceway, which wasÂ also blocked off. Inside the room, police say they found the body of a 38-year-old man who died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Police declined to identify the man, but said he’s a Michigan native who now livesÂ in Florida. Reports say the bullet went through aÂ wall andÂ into another room, but no other injuries were reported.
