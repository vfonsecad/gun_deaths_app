The motorcyclist shot and killed after leading a California Highway Patrol officer on a pursuit near Faria Beach north of Ventura Saturday was identified as a 58-year-old Ventura resident, according to the  a.inline_topic:hover { 	background-color: #EAEAEA; } Ventura County Medical Examiner’s Office this morning. The motorcyclist, Theodore Kenneth Keiper, died of multiple gunshot wounds, senior deputy medical examiner Craig Stevens said. The Ventura County Sheriff’s Office is heading up the investigation of the incident that occurred around 2:20 p.m. near Highway 101 and Padre Juan Canyon Road. Sheriff’s office spokesman Eric Buschow said the pursuit began as the officer was southbound on the old Pacific Coast Highway. The pursuit began after the officer, who was alone in the vehicle, saw a motorcycle speeding and tried to stop it but it failed to yield, Buschow said. During the pursuit, the Keiper turned onto Hobson Road and then onto Padre Juan Canyon Road, which passes over Highway 101, then travels north up an incline in a canyon between two mountains north of the highway. After passing over the highway and traveling some distance on Padre Juan Canyon Road, the motorcycle crashed and went down an embankment on the west side of Padre Juan Canyon Road, ending the chase, Buschow said. “At the termination of the pursuit, there was a shooting,” he said. “The motorcyclist died here at the scene.” Buschow said details of how many shots were fired or whether a weapon was drawn on the officer would not be released at the scene. He confirmed that the motorcyclist died from being shot, not from the crash. (Related story: Ventura motorcyclist killed after pursuit had history of minor offenses) He said law enforcement backup had not yet arrived when the shooting took place. “The officer simply was going to make a traffic stop and likely would have issued a ticket,” Buschow said. “Instead, it ended in a pursuit and ultimately a shooting.” After such a pursuit ends, it is standard procedure for an officer to have a weapon drawn, Buschow said. “They’ve already shown total disregard for the law,” he said. “You don’t know what they’re going to do.” The officer was not hurt, Buschow said. Buschow said the sheriff’s office is conducting the investigation at the request of the patrol. It’s standard procedure for an outside agency to conduct the investigation when an officer is involved in a fatal shooting. For example, the sheriff’s office also conducted the investigation after Oxnard police fired fatal gunshots in October. Soon after the incident occurred, the  a.inline_topic:hover { 	background-color: #EAEAEA; } Ventura County Fire Department reported that the California Highway Patrol was conducting the investigation. Later, Steve Reid, Ventura-area spokesman for the patrol, arrived at the site and instead said the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office would be conducting the investigation because the incident involved CHP personnel. After the initial call, the Ventura County Sheriff’s Office said it had provided three vehicles in support of the operation. The sheriff’s office at the time said the fire department requested the support of a helicopter but that the aircraft had returned to its base by 3:05 p.m. By Saturday night, the agency’s role at the scene had been upgraded. A command post for the sheriff’s office was set up at the site, and yellow crime scene tape blocked part of Padre Juan Canyon Road. In the hours after the shooting, officers had repeatedly enlarged the area enclosed by crime scene tape. Saturday night, the sheriff’s office was gathering evidence and interviewing the officer involved in the shooting and officers who arrived afterward, Buschow said. In addition, investigators planned to interview construction crew members who were working near a Highway 101 overpass in the area, he said. Whether the officer will be placed on administrative leave during the investigation will be the decision of the patrol, Buschow said. He said the investigation would last several hours Saturday night. The Ventura County Fire Department was asked to provide lighting at the scene so the investigation could be conducted. The narrow road leading to the scene, where members of the media gathered in the cold as they waited to speak with Buschow, was almost pitch black as the journalists began to leave around 7 p.m. Click here for approximate location of incident   				 				© 2013 Ventura County Star.
