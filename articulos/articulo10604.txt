1 1 The Mohave County Sheriff's Office says a man  has died after being shot by a deputy after the man allegedly threatened  the deputy with his own baton. The dead man was later identified as Blake Allen Barbour, 43, of Kingman.  Sheriff's spokeswoman Trish Carter says the fatal  shooting occurred Friday morning after a deputy responded to a report of  a man acting erratically and threatening family members at a residence  in the Kingman area. Carter says the man was combative and was shocked  several times without effect before he grabbed the deputy's baton and  swung it while approaching the deputy. According to Carter, the deputy shot the man when the man ignored several warnings. The deputy is on leave. The Sheriff's Office has requested the Bullhead City Police department to conduct the investigation to ensure impartiality. Copyright 2013 The Associated Press modified. KSAZ-TV & KUTP511 W.
