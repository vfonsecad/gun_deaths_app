1 The George County Sheriff's Department has confirmed the suspect and victims involved in the fatal shooting early Sunday morning in George County's Central Community. George County Sheriff's Public Information Officer Shonna Pierce said 27-year-old Clifford Byrd is the man accused of shooting and killing 27-year-old Nathan White and critically injuring his father 52-year-old Jerald Mitchell Cochran.  The shooting allegedly stemmed after Byrd, started doing donuts on White's family's property.  When 52-year-old Jerald Mitchell Cochran walked outside and asked Byrd to stop, an argument started.  Shortly after the argument, Byrd pulled up to Cochran's mobile home and knocked on the door. When Cochran and his two sons, Nathan White and 20-year-old Ryan White answered the door, Byrd allegedly started shooting at both Cochran and Nathan.  Pierce said Ryan grabbed a nearby gun and reportedly shot at Byrd hitting him multiples times.   Investigators have interviewed and released Ryan White.  Pierce said, the investigation is ongoing with still no motive for the shooting. Detectives said more arrests and charges are expected to follow. Cochran is being treated at University of South Alabama Medical Center in Mobile. Byrd is being treated at Singing River Hospital in Pascagoula. Both were last listed under critical condition.
