1 1 UPDATE: Tuesday, July 30 at 10:48pm Around 9pm, police identified the suspect as 29-year old Clifford Jones, a suspect in a narcotics investigation in the area this afternoon. Jones was shot at and killed after he drove away from police and then started shooting at them, according to the Benton Police Department. The police officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave. ******************************************* BENTON (KATV) - A police chase Tuesday afternoon ended with an officer-involved shooting and a section of interstate shut down just before afternoon rush hour. Officers said they saw a suspect from an ongoing investigation and started chasing them eastbound on I-30. Police were able to stop them using stop sticks to blow out the suspect's tires, forcing them to crash on the inside eastbound lane near the 121 mile marker between Alcoa Road and Springhill Blvd. The suspect then tried to shoot at officers and police fired back and the suspect died, though police could not confirm if he had been shot or died from injuries after his car wrecked. Bullet holes could be seen in the suspect's car. No word yet on if any officers were injured and police would not discuss what the suspect was wanted for. KATV's crew on the scene reported that westbound traffic was stop-and-go as of 5:00 p.m. State Police troopers opened one eastbound lane open but otherwise, the eastbound lanes are shut down so crime scene investigators can process the scene. All other traffic is being diverted to Highway 5.
