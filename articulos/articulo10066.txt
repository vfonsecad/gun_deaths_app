1 1 Baton Rouge Police say that two officers were involved in an early morning shooting that has left one man dead.  The shooting happened on Sunday just before 12:30 am.   It began when police officers were attempting to make a traffic stop in the 1400 block of Dalrymple Drive.  The driver of the vehicle they were trying to stop refused to pull over and drove through several neighborhoods at various speeds.   The officers pursued, attempting to stop the vehicle at the intersection of South Eugene and Louisiana Ave. That's when officers say the driver of the vehicle began to drive straight at them at a high rate of speed.  One of the officers fired multiple gunshots into the front windshield of the car, hitting the driver in the head.  He was pronounced dead at the scene. The driver has been identified as Tyris Wilkerson, 32, of Baton Rouge. The two officers have been placed on paid administrative leave, which is a standard procedure for officers involved shootings. Wilkerson was convicted in 1996 of second-degree murder after shooting 40-year-old Frederick Young in September of 1994. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison.  Wilkerson's case was unique because it was the first time local authorities had used a new law that allowed prosecutors to try 14-year-olds as adults.  Wilkerson was 14 at the time of the murder, and he was 15 when he was convicted by a jury.  The investigation is ongoing. Copyright 2013 WAFB. All rights reserved.   844 Government  Street  Baton Rouge, LA 70802   FCC Public File  (225) 383-9999EEO ReportClosed Captioning
