Police described Ramona Foreman as an innocent victim but had little else to say about the city's latest killing, which happened a little before 7 p.m. on International Boulevard. There was no arrest or report of anyone else being hurt in the violence. Foreman was listed as the city's 124th homicide victim this year. She and her sister were walking home from an East Oakland store when gunfire erupted after two cars pulled up on the other side of the divided boulevard. In an instant, the 48-year-old Foreman was shot dead. Her body crumpled in the doorway of the city of Oakland's 92nd Avenue Head Start office, which works with children from low-income families.  The neighborhood is no stranger to violence. Just several storefronts away is where the owner of a cell phone store was shot and killed on Halloween in an apparent robbery. Gabriel Martinez Jr., 5, and Carlos Nava, 3, both victims of errant bullets, were killed along the boulevard in separate incidents last year. On Thursday, Foreman's grieving relatives said their loss was too much to bear. "My mind is really gone right now," said her daughter Janetta Roberts, 30, as she stood outside her mother's home on 95th Avenue just blocks from the crime scene. "I'm just sad that this happened to my mother, because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time," Roberts said. "She didn't deserve any of this." She said she wanted Foreman, a grandmother to three, to be remembered as "the good mother that she was. She was a good, nice sweet lady. She made everybody laugh. She joked all the time. Everywhere she went, people liked her." She said her mother and aunt had just visited a local store and were heading back home when the gunfire erupted at 6:53 p.m. "My mom, she didn't move quick enough," Roberts said. The victim's stepdaughter, Aisha Roberts, said Foreman is the 13th person she knows to be killed on the streets of Oakland this year alone. This cuts too close to home, said Aisha Roberts, adding she will turn 19 on Sunday, just two days before Christmas. "The holidays will never be the same," Janetta Roberts said.  Her sister added forlornly, "My birthday will never be the same. Our parent was just caught in the crossfire. We don't know what's going on in our head. We don't know how to take this." Henry K.
