1   								  								  								  								  								  								 On December 31, 2012, at approximately 6:22 AM, Champaign police officers responded to a report of a shooting in the 1500 block of Honeysuckle. Upon arrival officers located two individuals with what appeared to be gunshot injuries. One subject was transported to Carle Hospital but both were later pronounced dead by the Champaign County Coronerâs Office. The two individuals involved have been identified as Emily Davis, 34, and Jason Woods, 37. Ms. Davis and Mr. Woods were reported to have been in a dating relationship for approximately one year. Both lived at the address on Honeysuckle and had one child together. At this time, the preliminary investigation indicates Mr. Woods and Ms. Davis were engaged in an argument prior to the shooting and at some point Mr. Woods shot Ms. Davis with a handgun. Mr. Woods then committed suicide by shooting himself. Champaign Police do not have any evidence at this time that would indicate this incident was anything other than a domestic related murder-suicide and that Mr. Woods is responsible for the death of Ms. Davis. In addition, anyone with information regarding this crime is urged to call the Champaign Police Department at (217) 351-4545 or callers can remain anonymous by contacting Crime Stoppers at (217) 373-8477 (TIPS). Information can also be provided via internet at www.373tips.com or text information anonymously by texting CCTIP plus information to 274637 (CRIMES).
