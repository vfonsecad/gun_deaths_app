1 1 View Homicides in Dallas February 2, 2013 in a larger map Three men are in the Dallas County morgue this morning: Two were shot to death Saturday evening in a drug deal gone bad in Northwest Dallas, according to police, while another was found stabbed to death about an hour earlier near Mountain View College in Oak Cliff. The stabbing victim has been identified by the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s office as 20-year-old Victor Castillo. At 5:58 p.m. Saturday, Dallas police were dispatched on a cutting call to the 1600 block of Western Park Drive, near W. Illinois Avenue and S. Cockrell Hill Road. There, they found a white 1995 Mazda crashed into a fence; inside was Castillo, who’d been stabbed in the chest. Police say Castillo was taken to Methodist Dallas Medical Center, where he died. Police say this morning that Castillo was “involved in a disturbance which escalated into a physical confrontation,” which led to his murder — by whom police aren’t saying just yet. But, according to Dallas police spokesman Sr. Cpl. Gerardo Monreal, “A suspect has been identified and detectives are working leads.” But police do not know who shot and killed 18-year-old Jesus Reyes and 22-year-old Andrew Aguilar Saturday night. The shooting occurred a little before 7 p.m. on Bolivar Drive near Webb Chapel Road, in the shadow of Dallas Love Field. Police say Reyes and Aguilar are brothers. According to the police report, Reyes and Aguilar had gone with someone else to pick up “an unknown suspect to conduct a drug transaction.” But it didn’t go as planned: “The transaction,” says the report, “went bad.” Monreal says they brothers were shot multiple times, and that “the unknown shooting suspect is at-large.” An investigation is ongoing.
