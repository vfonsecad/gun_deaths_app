1 Residents say they heard yelling, then gunshots just after 5 p.m. Friday evening and then a man was shot dead.  Avondale police are not releasing the names of those involved but neighbors tell CBS 5 News the victim was a married family man with four children of his own and also raising two children from his wife's first marriage. Police Sgt. Brandon Busse said the 911 call came out as a domestic dispute of some sort. Officers arriving on the scene near 117th Avenue and Jefferson found the man shot in the street. Paramedics pronounced him dead.Â   Police arrested the suspect less than two hours later. Dahjanee Yarbrough, who knows the family, said the suspect was the father of the wife's two children and the dispute may have arisen when one of the kids did not want to leave for visitation.  "She didn't want to go to the dad's house," said Yarbrough. "So, [the mom] was like, 'Well, I'm not going to make her go' and then the kid's dad got mad and then he called the police over to [the victim's] house and it was just chaos." Busse said he expected to release the identities of those involved on Saturday. CBS 5 News will update this story as details become available.  Copyright 2012 KPHO (Meredith Corporation).
