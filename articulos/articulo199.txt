ARKADELPHIA  Authorities in Clark County are investigating the shooting death of a Little Rock man. Clark County Sheriff Jason Watson said 36-year-old David Stewart was found dead Wednesday night at a home in Arkadelphia. Watson told the Daily Siftings Herald that officers responded to a report of a shooting and found Stewart dead from a gunshot wound. The sheriff says several people were at the home at the time of the shooting, but he would not comment on a possible motive. Watson says authorities arrested 42-year-old John Chad Griffin on a charge first-degree murder in the shooting death. Griffin is being held in the Clark County jail, and authorities did not know whether he had an attorney. Stewart’s body has been sent to the Arkansas Crime Laboratory for an autopsy.
