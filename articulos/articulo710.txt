Lavert Brown says he was making a promotional video for a friend inside the Ace of Spades night club, 2511 Romig Road, when the shooting happened about 2 a.m. The video shows people dancing to thumping hip-hop music when a crack can be heard and a man in a white hat can be seen falling to the ground. Brown and others ran from the club, many panicked and screaming. “Please tell me that’s a champagne bottle,” Brown says toward the end of the video. Brown, who does work for Akron Digital Media Center, said he saw the man lying on the ground outside the club with a bullet wound in his abdomen. He said he prayed that the man would recover. He said he never saw the shooter. The victim, identified by investigators as 26-year-old Desmond Ward of Grace Avenue, died during surgery at 3:35 a.m. at Akron General Medical Center.  Cause of death was a gunshot wound to the torso, the Summit County Medical Examiner’s Office determined in an autopsy Monday. No one else was injured. Detectives have not yet made an arrest. Brown and Mark Smith, another member of the Stop the Violence Akron Movement, provided a copy of the video to the Beacon Journal on Monday and also plan to share it with an Akron judge.  They hope the video will help raise awareness in the community about the violence that has been occurring. “We want the community to see what’s going on,” Smith said. The Stop the Violence Akron Movement has been attempting to raise awareness in the community about homicides in the area and has been taking steps to prevent further bloodshed. Smith said the group has been knocking on doors and reaching out to the community. “It just keeps happening,” he said. “It’s the families who suffer.” Anyone with information on the shooting is asked to call the Akron detective bureau at 330-375-2490.
