Police were called to the complex about midnight and found 24-year-old Anton “Tony” White, who was a resident of the complex, dead outside. Two other men in their early 20s were also shot, including a brother of White’s. One is in critical condition. The other man’s wounds are not life-threatening, Sgt. Dan Janson said. Police did not identify any suspects, but said they were questioning witnesses. “We don’t know that of the three persons that all three of them are victims,” Janson said. Police did not recover any weapons at the scene.

The beat goes on in the wild wild Westside!! Maybe if if the JSO was on the Westside, it might not happen as often.  I know Normandy is the dividing line but it shouldn't mean no one patrols it. That's not true Westside Conservative, I see them in their cars on 103rd all the time. They are the ones running yellow lights, not using their turn signals. Now there is a new Waffle House maybe we will see more of them. "men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil." John 3:19–21 I'm not a zealot that constantly quotes the Bible, but this quote seems to sum up why everytime I wake up in the morning, I read about a shooting occurring between midnight and 3 am. Good news is that in the event 'bad' neighborhood extends west or east the phenomenon will eventually trail off and cease in woodlands off limits to development or the river. The JSO presence within this section is significant. The amount of call ins and other statistics impressive. One wonders if the area could even afford to pay for it's LE needs if it were outside consolidated arrangement and standing as it's own city. sandbiskit How many gangs are on 103rd street now?  About a decade ago, it was reported that there were some 490 or something like that, close to 500.  I grew up in a nearby neighborhood and it's sad that I don't even want to cross the railroad tracks anymore to take a trip down memory lane.  The last time I did was 4 years ago, and our old house looks like crap now.  I wouldn't be surprised if somebody had a meth lab in it.  Well, as soon as the gubmint takes everybody's guns away, these senseless killings and gang activity will stop!  (Another Washington fairytale). .... not in my neighborhood..... where will I buy drugs??? Yeah WestsideConservative--let's blame the police, as usual because they can be EVERYWHERE EVERYTIME a crime/shooting occurs. *smh* It's hard for them to patrol b/c most of them were laid off, and Officers are just up and leaving because they haven't had a pay raise in years yet have so much more work put on them....but go ahead and complain because you don't want taxes raised so they not cut anymore and/or can hire more police officers to help make the streets safer. How about blaming the suspects who felt they needed to shoot 3 people, killing one of them because of...lemme guess, I'm going to go out on a limb and say....drug related??? Maybe? I've driven by this complex and it is creepy to say the least. Definitely section 8 and looks like a dump. Rather than blame the police, what is the owner doing to make certain tenants are safe and the rif-raf have not taken over the complex. Annie1 BEAR - You sure did hit the nail on the head with that comment!  And people don't like truth and so that's why there are thumbs down already. Lets add some facts to these bloggers mis-statements: First of all westside conservative, the dividing line is no where near Normandy Blvd. the dividing line is I10. 103rd St is the dividing line between two subsectors. Also, staffing is way down for the last three years. Zone 4 is in need of about 20 officers just to get back to staffing levels from about three years ago, not to mention the loss of community safety officers. If anyone wants to complain about how long it takes to get officers to a call, you need to let the city council know about it. Less taxes = less police = worse service. you get what you pay for. the last thing about westchase court...its NOT an apartment complex. It is a bunch of quadruplex buildings, all owned by different owners. each building has its own address. Its a cesspool, just as bad as Indian Lakes Apartments, which borders the property. But because its NOT an apartment complex, its more difficult to enforce things like trespassing undesirables. I don't blame the police. I blame Bill Clinton for section 8 housing laws that are ruining nice neighborhoods........... When I first moved to Jax in the early 80s, a new friend of mine told me one of the most valuble pieces of advice I've ever received. He said it doesn't matter where you live in Jax as long as you stay out of reach of the bus routes. Ive never forgotten that.I've also stayed beyond the bus routes. Thank you Val Armorr for clarification on ownership. I now understand the difficulty of cleaning up the cesspool as you describe it. However, the owners of each individual unit does bear some responsibility for what is taking place in their quadruplex.  There are responsibilities that come with being a landlord and screening tenants is one of them.  Westchase court and Indian Lakes are slums pure and simple. Start with code enforcement (Mayor Brown, this is where you come in along with that great budget) and notify each owner regarding the safety of their units. I fully understand property rights, and know that people have to live somewhere but these slum, drug dens ruin communities. Bus routes and section 8 apartments, any apartments for that matter. “We don’t know that, of the three persons, that all three of them are victims,”  If all three were shot, I'd say all three were victims. @jagforlife, you nailed it. I got the same advice on the bus route thing. The example I got was Regency Square. How it was once one of the top malls in the country and then it got on the bus route and look at it now. You can always count on the Westside thugs to aide in population control. I'm so glad we have Angela Corey and her prosecution rate is so high because this stuff hardly ever happens now... Just another excuse for the sheriff to come on and say he doesn't have enough money to hire analysts and his friends......oops I mean police officers. Zone 4 has always been that busy...it's never got the attention it deserved because we have to protect zone 5 or the sheriffs panties will crimp up... Section 8 housing is such a wonderful thing. Section 8. Coming to a neighborhood near you. The government decided that just because you don't have a job doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to live in a nice house. Government is funding a new program where people on welfare are moving into 150K to 200K homes. I use to live at Westchase from 88-89. Back then it was a fairly nice place to live. People cared about the way their place looked. Drive in there now and the place looks like trash. It's sad when a certain group of people trash the place and have no pride in the place they live. Crime is so bad there that the Post Office had to move the mail boxes to the front of the complex because the people delivering the mail did not feel safe going to the back to have to put the mail in the cubicles. I bet even Jesse Jackson would not feel safe living there.  					Times-Union/Jacksonville.com 			  					Our Network
