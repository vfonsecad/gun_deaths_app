1 1 SALEM, Ore. – A man who was shot outside a Salem apartment after a fight early Saturday morning died at a hospital, according to police. Charlie Rivera, 23, of Woodburn, died Saturday evening. Lt. Dave Okada said the several shots were fired in the parking lot of the Londonaire Apartments at 955 Concord Avenue Northeast at around 3:45 a.m. Police found a Rivera sitting in a parked car. An autopsy is planned for Monday morning, police said. Police tried to use a K-9 to search for a suspect, but they were unsuccessful. There is no suspect information at this time, police said. Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call Detective Tony Vandekoppel at 503-540-2353.    I am hoping that LE finds some answers. Charlie was a great worker, and seemed like a nice polite kid. May he RIP and his family get some closure as to what really happened.    http://www.koin.com/2013/09/08/salem-apt-shooting-victim-dies/  Too many people are dying at hospitals lately! Care to do an indepth story about why, KATU? LOL  What's "a Rivera"???  Londonaire.ÃÂ ÃÂ ÃÂ  sounds appealing   3:45am, Saturday morning... NE Salem.ÃÂ  Gunshots you say? Wow... I'm... so..... ummmm..... astonished.ÃÂ  *sarcasm intended* A quick check of the Marion Co, and city of Salem police blogs for calls brings one quickly to the conclusion that if you desire to buy property or live in Salem, pretty much avoid everywhere within 20 blocks of Lancaster drive in any direction. I would also suggest that you avoid most areas between Mission & Center streets, from 12th street to Lancaster as well.ÃÂ  Now, we could go into discussions about the demographics of the area surrounding Lancaster, and how that has affected everything from crime rates to property values.... but that would be politically incorrect.  Could not afford the gas to drive down to the vista bridge   So this is just a repost from Flash Alert .com I have seen a number of news bits just reposted from FA.com. SO the posts are sent from LEO or their PIO.  So close to home (figuratively)   Whew! ÃÂ Glad nothing like this ever happens in Portland.ÃÂ   ...sigh... just another peaceful incident in our beautiful NE part of town...ÃÂ  When I first moved here (1989), that area of town was mostly families - working people - homes and yards nicely kept up... Now it's mostly gangs... I haven't been up there in years - no plans to go, either..! ÃÂ ÃÂ   Some wayward gang banger from Portland was smoking pot, got lost, and ended up in Salem. ÃÂ As for the shooter, he could be from anywhere.  Can you tell us when some one is NOT shot in Salem? This seems to happen every day there.  All our government needs to do is enact more gun laws and require a psychiatric evaluation as well as a detailed personal background check, including friends, relatives, and other associates. ÃÂ  If we raise the cost of guns, people with a low income cannot purchase the firearm, and we all know most crime happens in low income neighborhoods.ÃÂ  Since Roe v Wade and The Brady Act, crime has decreased dramatically.ÃÂ  But with the rate of overpopulation booming, the numbers do not seem to be as significant as they used to.ÃÂ  Instead of investing in wars, we should be investing in stricter gun laws and family planning clinics, as well as vaccines to help lower crime and the population.  How could this happen?  Salem has strict gun laws that are very clear.    No ÃÂ information in the Salem paper article, except this one beat the Salem paper by over a half an hour, hate do depend on them for news.   If it were not for all the fine culture and entertainment in Salem, it would seem like an unwelcome place to live.   Since this happened in Salem, I ascertain the suspect is Hispanic.   @jpkÃÂ SWAT teams are getting them.ÃÂ    @jpkÃÂ Reminds me of the Civil War, going to the hospital tent was more deadly than the Minnie Ball in your leg LOL  @jpkÃÂ In this case my hunch is the gunshot had something to do with it! ÃÂ ;)  Something on the southern French coast? If they spelt it right anyway? LOL  @Rob C 503ÃÂ  Vehicle made by Pontiac I believe.  How about just avoiding Salem altogether?  @GrapeApeÃÂ  That would be up as Portland is north of Salem.  Pure lack of initiative   @margay1ÃÂ The expansion of section 8 apartment complexes on Lancaster around Chemeketa was the proverbial nail in the coffin. Couple that with the influx of certain demographic groups between Sunnyview and Ward Drive, and you have a perfect storm guaranteed to not only lower property values in the surrounding areas, but also exponentially increase crime rates.ÃÂ  If it weren't for necessity, I wouldn't be on that end of town. Ever.ÃÂ    @waffleÃÂ Yes we need to reduce the population to 500 million. Reduce the number of worthless eaters to a more manageable level. See the Rosicrucian'sÃÂ Georgia guide stones for more information. War and vaccines are way to slow on the elimination excess populations. We need more insane people in public office to push the agenda forward.  @Where's Tracksuit Al Sharpton?ÃÂ They are written in English......  @fxholeatheistÃÂ ~ ÃÂ Sadly, we have a couple of areas in the city that have deteriorated... NE Salem and down around Four Corners, too... We have "Felony Flats", too, over around the prison... but other than those neighborhoods, the rest of the city is pretty quiet and peaceful, most of the time anyway...  @fxholeatheistÃÂ I think it's unwelcome to anyone with common sense. Politicians hate that!  @communicationÃÂ  =( ÃÂ  I wanted to drop to my knees too but the timing wasn't right.  @communicationÃÂ  I had expected wild laughter. But this is OK.  @QuantrillÃÂ  I suspect it's political...After all, it IS Salem.  @ProgressiveConservativeÃÂ @Rob C 503ÃÂ  Shame on you. ÃÂ Buick.  Buick....  Good one, Pro   @jpkÃÂ Just have your personal SWAT team to take care of business.  @jpkÃÂ  ~ Awww, now is that a nice thing to say..? ÃÂ  Like nothing bad ever happens in or around Portland..??? ÃÂ  ÃÂ  Seriously, though... I could do nicely without the politicians that hang out here from time to time, but other than that, Salem is a pretty decent place to live... ÃÂ  :-)  @PhuzzÃÂ MUst be, it's surely not from the lack of targets.  TouchÃÂ© touchÃÂ©...  @SunDownerÃÂ Not ready?   @ProgressiveConservativeÃÂ @QuantrillÃÂ I'm still thinking of a response.   @SunDownerÃÂ Sounds like your internet is a tease.  It was on when I typed that ^ but guess what?   Grrrrrr.   @SunDownerÃÂ @QuantrillÃÂ lol.  @QuantrillÃÂ  ÃÂ OK, that comment RAWKS!!!   @SunDownerÃÂ @QuantrillÃÂ Lol....did you mean "no juander it's not totally fixed yet"?  @QuantrillÃÂ  ÃÂ Hope you know what this means: ÃÂ His name is Juan, not Carlos. ÃÂ No wonder it's not totally fixed yet. =)
