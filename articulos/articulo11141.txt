1 1   Arlington police say an early-morning double-shooting was likely a murder-suicide. At about 5:15 a.m., officers responded to a shooting call at a home on the 6800 block of Biondi Trail, not far from Eden Road and state Highway 287 on the city's southwest side. Few details about the shooting are known, but police have said that the shooting appears to be related to a domestic incident where a man shot a woman several times before turning the gun on himself.  Both the woman and man, whose names have not been released, were transported to Methodist Mansfield Medical Center.  Upon arrival, the woman was pronounced dead.  The man was transported to John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, where he was reported to be in critical condition for several hours until he died early in the afternoon. According to police, investigators are working to determine a motive in the shooting. Police said the couple had been together for a number of years. Officials said the woman's teenage son and adult daughter were home and sleeping at the time of the shooting, but were not injured. Further details have not been released by police.
