(WHNT) – Police have identified the two men who died in an apparent murder-suicide. It happened just after 8:00 p.m. Monday in the 1400 block of 3rd Street SW, which is about a block from West Elementary School in Cullman.  Police say David Eugene Abney, 42, of Cullman was found shot to death in the front yard of the home.  The man suspected of shooting him was Terry Glen Bailey, 54, of Cullman. “They had been friends at one time and it had developed into some kind of feud and it even reached a physical point back in December,” said Police Chief Kenny Culpepper.  “There had been a physical fight to which we were called.” Police say neither of the men involved lived at the home on 3rd Street SW.  Police say Abney was apparently visiting a woman and child who lived there.  It appears Bailey pulled up to the home and shot Abney at least four times and then turned the gun on himself. Police say they found Bailey in his car.  He was taken to Cullman Regional Medical Center where doctors pronounced him dead. Police say they still do not know the specifics of why the two had been feuding. Watch our weekly segments on what’s happening in Downtown Huntsville.
