The bodies of Zachary Robert Johns and Kayla Marie Beynon, both 23, were discovered about 6:45 p.m. by Johns’ sister, who also lived in the condo at the Cottages at Oakleaf, 3750 Silver Bluff Road, said Mary Justino, spokeswoman for the Sheriff’s Office. Beynon had been shot at least twice in the torso. Johns had a single gunshot wound to the head. A .40-caliber handgun was used in the shootings. It belonged to Johns and was found near his body, Justino said. A man at the Beynon family home who identified himself as her father said they had no comment Thursday. Johns’ family couldn’t be reached. The shootings apparently resulted from an altercation. Family members told detectives that the couple had been arguing a lot lately and seemed to be about to break up, Justino said. Deputies had responded to the home, near Orange Park, once before. A month ago at Beynon’s request, a deputy went there to keep the peace while she removed personal belongings from the condo. Family members said Beynon continued living there with Johns after that call for service, Justino said. The couple was alone in the home when the shootings occurred. Although not married, Johns and Beynon had one child together, a 6-month old son. Beynon also had a 2-year-old son. Both children remain in the care of Beynon’s mother, Justino said. The bodies were found in a common area on the ground floor of the two-story condo. teresa.stepzinski@jacksonville.com, (904) 359-4075 PREV New York newspaper that published pistol permit database now has armed guards NEXT Jacksonville youth minister arrested on molestation charges please read our user agreement and privacy policy before posting One thing about Zachary he was one of the sweetest most caring ppl I kno. Right, he's such a nice buy that he killed the mothr of his child. Couldn't just walk away or at least kill just himself. Might I suggest that you find a better class of people to know? Everyone makes typos, especially on the internet. But intentionally misspelling words makes you look ignorant and few people will take you seriously. Everyone makes typos, especially on the internet.

RIP..... @Brog81510 It sounds like you are suffering from the same anger issues Zachary Johns had, this is a PUBLIC forum and as citizens we are all entitled to our opinions.  Of course if the truth is too difficult for you to read (I never understand why family/friends troll these sites after a tragedy, but hey it's your right) then don't.   The facts which are not in dispute Johns shot and killed Beynon then turned the gun on himself.  Sounds like an angry coward who couldn't move on.  Now his child has no parents.  Selfish, angry coward! To everyone man or woman, if you decide to leave and you go with a LEO to keep the peace while you gather your personal effects (smart) if you go back alone and even stay with the person you were so afraid of you took a LEO to get your stuff in the first place (not smart).  I hope the family of the victim is able to care for her children and make a good life for them. One of the worst things about this story is the times union trying to get a statement from the family. The TU even went as far as to go to their home.  Leave these people alone to grieve, have some sympathy. Maybe he would get more sympathy if he were a Kansas City Chief and not just a regular old nobody shacked up in a trailer.  Vote BANE for President November 2012 My guess is that neither he nor Belcher care at this point what anyone on the TU website say about them. This type of violence seems to be the new trend, with couples.  If I can't have you then nobody else can.....bang, bang...bullet for you and one for myself........too many copy cats out there......praying that this stops.......
