Just before 10 p.m. Springfield Police were called to the 800 block of West Jefferson Street on reports of multiple shots fired. When police arrived on scene they found a deceased man laying in the middle of the street with a car parked along the curb nearby. The victim had been shot, police said. The crime scene was immediately taped off and crime scene detectives began collecting evidence. The Springfield police called for a larger presence of law enforcement because a large crowd gathered. Family members and friends who heard about the man’s death were trying to enter the crime scene area. Police called for the extra back up to protect the forensic evidence of the crime scene, police said. Some people have been interviewed who police hope can help aid in finding the reason for the shooting and the identity of the shooter. A description of possible suspects has not been released at this time. Springfield Police are encouraging anyone with information to call them at 937-324-7716. This shooting remains under investigation.  © 2014 Cox Media Group.
