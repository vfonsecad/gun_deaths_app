The girl’s family said 7-year-old Desirae Macias is now brain dead and on life support at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles. They expect her to be taken off life support. “Her heart’s pumping because she’s on medicine. Her organs are only working because she’s on life support,” the girl’s aunt, Alicia Galvan, told KTLA-TV. “Her brain’s not functioning.”    Galvan added the family is waiting to disconnect the life support systems so that family members can see her one last time. “They’re going to disconnect her; we’re just waiting for the grandma to get there,” she said. Three suspects have been arrested in connection with the shooting, although police say there may be more people involved. The girl’s family drove away from a Mobil gas station at Fort Tejon Road and Pearblossom Highway after getting into an argument with men in another car. The men reportedly followed the family in their own vehicle.    The second car opened fire near the intersection of Sunburst and Stratford drives, and the child was hit by at least one bullet as the family was chased down residential streets. She was in the back seat of the family’s red Toyota Corolla, which was hit by several bullets. Investigators from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department gathered evidence at three different locations along the route where shots were fired. After the shooting and chase ended in front of the family’s home, they discovered the little girl had been shot in the head. She was airlifted to the hospital, according to authorities.    A short time after the incident, sheriff’s deputies in the area saw a car matching the description given by the family. Three suspects were arrested and booked on attempted murder charges. The identities of the suspects have not been released. Investigators are looking for two more suspects who were in the car at the time of the shooting. Anyone with information is asked to call sheriff’s detectives at 661-272-2400.  Reach the author at KellyGoff@Dailynews.com           or follow Kelly on Twitter: @KellyGoff_DN.
