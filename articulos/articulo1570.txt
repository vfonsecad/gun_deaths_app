1 1 A 39-year-old woman was shot dead on the steps of a Lauderhill condo complex late Monday, police said. It happened around 8:45 p.m. on the 2800 block of Northwest 55th Avenue at the Stonebridge Condominiums, Capt. Rick Rocco said. The victim was identified as Adrienne P. Simmons but police were unable to confirm where she lived and whether she was homeless. Investigators believe Simmons may have known her attacker, Rocco said. A perimeter was set up around the neighborhood immediately after the shooting but no suspect was found. Detectives were questioning a few witnesses in the area but they believe many more may know what happened and are failing to come forward, he said. Investigators are urging anyone with information related to this killing to contact either Broward Crime Stoppers at 954-493-8477 or place an anonymous text to TIP 411 [847411] beginning with the text with the letters LPD followed by the information.
