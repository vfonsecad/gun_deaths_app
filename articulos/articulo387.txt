1 (Jan. 22) -- Metro Police are investigating an apparent suicide at a local shooting range. Police say a man took his own gun into "American Shooters Supply    " on Arville and Spring Mountain and shot himself.   Channel 8 Eyewitness News Reporter LuAnne Sorrell has a look at what happened.  Suicides at gun ranges: they've made headlines around the country--from California to Texas--and now it happened againâ€¦right here in Las Vegas. A man took his life at American Shooters just before noon stunning a tour group that was there for practice shooting. The owner of the shooting range says the man came in with his own handgun. He spent a long time practice shooting before turning the gun on himself. He was killed instantly with a shot to the head. This isn't the first time something like this has happened here. Just three years ago, a man came into American Shooters and shot himself.  The difference is that this time he didn't bring in his own gun but he rented one. The family of 50-year-old Thomas Murphy filed a lawsuit a year later. According to Murphy's Family Attorney Rob Murdock, "In this case Mr. Murphy was extremely agitated, extremely nervous--he couldn't he couldn't hang his own target [which] is simply hanging up a few paper clips." American Shooters owner Ron Montoya said back then, and still says, he takes security very seriously: "If we feel at any time you've been drinking or you're unhappy but we feel you're being unsafe we remove you from the range." Back in 2000, Montoya said that Murphy didn't appear to be unhappy, and he says, neither did the victim in this most recent shooting. Part of the lawsuit filed in 2001 claims that "American Shooters" violated the "Brady Bill" which requires a waiting period to buy a gun. But it's unclear if this waiting period applies to rented guns.The case goes to trial June 16th. Related Links                                  (Copyright 2003 by  The Associated Press.)
