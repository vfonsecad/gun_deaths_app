She told dispatchers that Meadows, who was her roommate, kept pointing a gun at her, saying he'd shoot anyone who came into the house.The roommate then locked herself in a bathroom. When police arrived, they say Meadows would not come out of the home. A hostage negotiation specialist tried to get Meadows out peacefully.  Police say when Meadows did eventually come out of the house, he pointed a gun at officers. That's when officer shot Meadows. He died at the hospital. Meadow's family tells WKYT they are devastated to start the new year without Meadows. "He was a great man. He would always help people out. I mean, it is the start of a new year. I never thought we'd be starting it like this. I just lost my daddy and I never thought he'd go out this way," said his daughter, Ashley Meadows.  Ashley Meadows says she still has question about exactly what happened at her father's home. "Why did they kick his door in? Why would they let him come outside and wave a gun around? When you walk to the side of the house, there's a bullet hole over there. There's blood over there. How did he get shot over there?"
