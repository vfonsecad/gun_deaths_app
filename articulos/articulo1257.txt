1   By Eric Kurhi ekurhi@mercurynews.com SAN JOSE -- The victim of the city's first homicide of 2013, who was found shot to death in front of a home on Sunday, was identified by police as Ivan Segura, 34. Segura, a San Jose resident, was shot at least once and pronounced dead around 8 a.m. at the scene on the 1900 block of Tripoli Avenue. Police did not release additional details about the homicide on Wednesday and said there are no suspects in custody and a motive is not known. Neighbors previously said the shooting happened around 11 p.m. the previous night, but officers who responded did not locate Segura's body. One neighbor said he heard an argument followed by two gunshots, and a car was reported speeding away from the scene. Segura's killing comes after a year that saw 46 homicides in San Jose -- the most in 20 years. In 2012, the first slaying of the year happened on Jan. 5 when Ricardo Lucas, 25, was shot to death in East San Jose. Contact Eric Kurhi at 408-920-5852. Follow him at Twitter.com/erickurhi.
