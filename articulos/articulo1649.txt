1 1 Hardin County Sheriff's Deputies are sifting through the facts surrounding a Thursday-night shooting death. Sheriff Ed Cain tells 12News that just before 8 p.m. deputies were called to a home located at 14279 Pineville Road off of Gore Store Road in Village Mills.  This is north of Kountze.   Deputies determined that a disturbance happened between Troy Marshall, 50, and his estranged wife Denise Marshall, 47.   Doris King says she is a good friend of the Marshalls'. She tells 12News "You wouldn't have believed this would have happened. Denise and Troy were always together." King says she's trying to come to grips with how tragedy struck a loving couple in a quiet neighborhood. "Right at your own back door. You know people but you don't expect this at your own back door," says King. Sheriff Cain said Troy had been drinking and forced his way into Denise's house.  He was able to knock her to the ground and began to choke her.   "He got her down on the floor and was on top of her choking her. She stated she was about to lose consciousness when she heard a loud noise," says Cain. Cain says that loud noise was gunshots fired by Denise Marshall's live-in boyfriend, 22-year-old Wallace Hooks. Hooks was at the house when this happened.  He retrieved a .40 cal. pistol and fired multiple times, according to Cain.   "My sister-in-law lives right next door. She didn't even hear anything or know anything was going on until somebody called and told her," says King. Sheriff Cain said say Mr. Marshall was dead by the time deputies arrived at the home. No other people were at the house when the shooting happened. King said the two use to help her son anytime he was in need. She tells 12News, everyone has problems, but she did not know Troy and Denise's were this bad.  "They were real good friends and I'm sorry this happened. Denise and Troy were good people. They really were," says King. King also told 12News the couple had a daughter who is in her 30's. Deputies are working to find evidence that will help determine if the shooting was in self defense, or if it is a murder.  They say Marshall and Hooks are cooperating with investigators. Sheriff Cain says they are still waiting on autopsy and toxicology results.  Once the investigation has concluded, all evidence will be turned over to the District Attorney to decide if charges should be filed. Sheriff Cain told 12News Mr. and Mrs. Marshall had filed for divorce, but it had not yet become final.           Newsroom: (409) 838-1212        Front Desk: (409) 833-7512        News Fax: (409) 981-1564        News Email: 12News@kbmt12.com
