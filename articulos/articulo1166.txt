Gerald L. Banta attacked his estranged wife at her home because he was upset about her relationship with another man, Mattoon police Deputy Chief Jason Taylor said. Banta, 34, of Mattoon died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Coles County Coroner Ed Schniers said Friday. Schniers said an autopsy is scheduled for Saturday but only to verify the cause of death. Taylor said police were alerted to the incident about 9:20 a.m. Friday. The investigation showed that Banta went to the womanâs residence in the 900 block of North 12th Street and was waiting for her there when she came home from work around 6 a.m., he said. What followed was a âviolent and prolongedâ attack during which the woman was beaten âoff and onâ over a three-hour period, Taylor said. He wouldnât give details about the attack but said the woman is expected to recover. âSheâs lucky to be alive,â Taylor said. âIt was a prolonged assault.â The woman was taken to Sarah Bush Lincoln Health Center after the attack. Taylor said she would likely be released after treatment. He added that the âevidence in the case pointsâ to Banta planning a murder-suicide but wouldnât elaborate. Police do not think the woman shot Banta, he said. The incident was more of an argument between Banta and the woman when another woman arrived at the home and interrupted it, Taylor said. It was shortly after that Banta shot himself, he said. The attack and suicide came two days after Banta pleaded guilty to an assault charge alleging he threatened the same woman with a gun on Dec. 11. Taylor confirmed that the same woman was the victim in both incidents. The agreement in the assault case included no contact with the woman as one of the requirements of the two-year probation sentence Banta received, according to the caseâs records.
