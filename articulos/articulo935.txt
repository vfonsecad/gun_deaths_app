1 A family from Richmond is clinging to one another after they say a nightmare became a reality, early this morning. Lynn Taylor, Jr., 31, was shot and killed in his car on East 34th Street, early Sunday morning. Police are still searching for the gunman. Taylor's family is in disbelief. His mother, Rose Taylor, received a call that every mother would trade her life not to hear. At about 4 a.m., police told her that her oldest son was shot, and killed. "I want my son back," said Taylor through tears. "I miss him already…I look at his picture, and I want my son back." Shattered glass from Lynn Taylor's car window is all that now remains on the sidewalk. A neighbor, who asked to keep his identity concealed, says he heard seven gunshots. He says others nearby tried to help the victim in his car, before police arrived. "They were hysterical...One of them checked his pulse." Now, two children will grow up without their father. Lynn Taylor's seven younger siblings will no longer have their big brother to admire. "He's a family man. He loved to be around his family," said Rose Taylor, of her son. "This has got to end. I don't know what is going on out there... I want my son back." The family is planning a vigil for Lynn in the coming weeks. Richmond police are asking anyone with information to please call Crime Stoppers at 780-1000. You can also text Crime Stoppers at "274637" and entering the key word "ITIP" before your message. Both calling or texting is anonymous. Copyright 2012 WWBT NBC12. All rights reserved.    			P.O.
