It happened around 2 p.m. Monday on Roycroft Drive, on the city's northeast side.  Police identify the victim as Gregory Cooper, 24, of Rochester.  It was the middle of the day when the neighborhood was disrupted by gunshots.  "In mid daylight, two o' clock in the afternoon, kids coming from school," said Pastor Britt Pledger, Stop Kill'n Start Chill'n President. "You got kids, not just my kids but you got other kids in the neighborhood," said Calvin Simpson. Simpson lives in the neighborhood. "I pretty much just keep my kids in the house, but I am concerned," said Simpson. He says he's concerned after hearing a 24-year old man from the neighborhood was shot several times. Cooper was found by police lying in the middle of the street by an officer who was flagged down by someone near the scene. "A officer was actually on patrol down the street, there was a little bit of a traffic jam. A citizen walked up to the officer, the officer, she's familiar with that citizen, and said an individual was shot in the middle of the street." Police say the officers first onscene tried to give CPR; still, the Cooper died at the hospital a short time later.  The shooting is now Rochester's first homicide this year and the first one in the city since November. "This is homicide number one. Do we challenge number two, what do we do," said Pledger. Police say this happened at a busy time of day, where there were probably a number of witnesses. They are now depending on the community to provide some answers. "It's discouraging, very discouraging. It's sad. I think people of the community need to rise up and come against this foolishness that's going on around here," said Simpson. The incident is still under investigation.
