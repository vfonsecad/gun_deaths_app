(AP) - Police are continuing to search for suspects in the deadly shooting of a Tuskegee University student gunned down at a block party over the weekend.   WSFA-TV reports that Tuskegee police and the Alabama Bureau of Investigation are investigating the Friday night slaying of 21-year-old Bobby Smith of Mableton, Ga., just northwest of Atlanta. He was shot in the back and later pronounced dead at a local hospital.   Tuskegee University President Gilbert Rochon said in a statement that the university community is mourning the death, and "we are all deeply affected by this terrible incident."   Smith, a finance major who played for Tuskegee's tennis team, was the father of a baby who is less than a month old.   Authorities say they're not certain of the shooter's motive.
