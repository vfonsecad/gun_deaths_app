1 1 Authorities have identified the 24-year-old East Hills man who was shot to death just before 6:30 p.m. today in the 2100 block of Park Hill Drive. The police who first arrived performed CPR, but Derrick Lyman was pronounced dead in the emergency room at UPMC Presbyterian by 6:55 p.m., according to the Allegheny County Medical Examiner's office. He was shot in the arm and chest and found lying in a hallway, Major Crimes Lt. Daniel Herrmann said. Neighbors said there were children playing not far from the shots. No arrests have been made and the motive remained unclear, police said. Neighbors who knew Mr. Lyman expressed shock -- saying he wasn't someone they expected to be caught up in violence. "There's no incentives for these kids, that's why they're killing each other," said a longtime friend and former East Hills resident. "We have all these meetings and have all these rallies -- we need to educate them." Debra Lawrence, a 55-year-old East Hills resident and friend of the victim, said she heard several gunshots and ran inside the complex to find the victim unconscious with several gunshot wounds. She said the victim had been arguing with two other people earlier in the day. She said she saw two people run away immediately after the shooting. Witnesses told police that a black male suspect was seen fleeing the scene wearing a light gray hoodie and khaki shorts. "We knew [him] all his life," Ms. Lawrence said of the victim. "He was a sweet, sweet boy." Jessica Contrera contributed. Alex Zimmerman: azimmerman@post-gazette.com or 412-263-3909. Twitter @AGZimmerman.
