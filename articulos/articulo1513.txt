Officers responded to the 2700 block of Westlane Road just before 7:30 Sunday evening investigating reports of a person shot. When they arrived, they found 30-year-old Ousmane Goudiaby suffering from an apparent gunshot wound. Detectives searched the area for witnesses but have not been able to determine a motive or suspect information. Police said Goudiaby moved to America from Africa in 2008 and was in the process of obtaining a second college degree.  He was working part-time in the business where he was killed. Anyone with information about this incident is urged to contact Homicide detectives at 317-327-3475, or contact CrimeStoppers anonymously at 317-262-TIPS (8477). VIEW & ADD COMMENTS "There is no word on the identities or conditions of either victim."  You said one was dead, at least we know of one's condition. As to the home invasion dirtbag, maybe he'll die too.  let me know i think i might know one of them,pray not!  they need 2 bring back capital punshment, why should tax payers take of them. there would be less crime.  "Detectives searched the area for witnesses but have not been able to determine a motive or suspect information"  And evrybody knows that people will not help the police, unless money might be involved.  Nobody is going to help the police do their job– thats what they get paid for!  Comment  You should help the police find if you are good christian it could happen to everyone. Because it was not fair to take somebody life after he gave the killersthe money they asked. Goudiaby was a good man, a man who people in Africa have HOPE. He was helping families to survive. So they killed an entire COMMUNITY, and FAMILY. Africans come to this just to work and help who ever need help. In the SAKE of GOD if you are believers please HELP.
