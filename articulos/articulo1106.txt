1   Philadelphia homicide detectives were busy investigating two killings overnight, including the gruesome discovery of a bound body found inside a burning minivan. That makes five homicides in the city since the start of the New Year. In the first incident last night, investigators said firefighters were called to a report of a burning vehicle in a vacant lot shortly before midnight Wednesday near 19th and Westmoreland Streets in the city's Tioga section. Chief Inspector Scott Small told reporters at the scene that firefighters went to extinguish the blaze and saw the body of a yet unidentified male in the back of the van. He was bound at the wrists and ankles by duct tape. In a separate overnight killing in the city, police are investigating the fatal shooting of a man in Overbrook. Authorities said the slaying happened on the 6000 block of Haddington Street - also shortly before midnight. No one has been taken into custody and police offered no information about a potential motive. The man's name was not released because his family is still being notified.
