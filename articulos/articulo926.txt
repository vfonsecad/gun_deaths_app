December 29, 2012                                                          RICHLAND COUNTY, SC —  A bar fight that turned deadly in the early morning hours Saturday in Lower Richland County has left one dead and the suspect in the hospital with charges pending, officials say. Cornelius L. Green, 37, of Hopkins, died at Palmetto Health Richland after he was shot in the upper body, said Richland County Coroner Gary Watts. Deputies with the county sheriff’s department are investigating the incident that occurred at about 1:30 a.m. Saturday at Tony’s Lounge, on Congaree Road in Eastover, department spokesman Curtis Wilson said. The fight started as a verbal altercation inside the club between Calvert Myers, 51, and his niece, Wilson said. That altercation turned physical and the two, along with Green, the woman’s boyfriend, were asked to leave the club. Once outside, Myers pushed his niece to the ground, Wilson said. Green then tried to come to her defense. Myers then pulled out a weapon and fired a number of shots at Green, Wilson said. Other people at the club tried to come to the aid of the victim. Green died later at the hospital, Watts said. Myers is hospitalized with injuries. He will be arrested and charged with murder, Wilson said.
