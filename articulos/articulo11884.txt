WOODY MARSHALL — wmarshall@macon.com |Buy Photo                                                      A 19-year-old shot to death at a west Macon motel may have tried to rob the man who killed him, according to a police report. Darius Washington, shot once in the left side of his chest, was found dead on the back side of the Scottish Inn at 5022 Romeiser Drive about 4:30 a.m. Monday. The motel, once a Howard Johnsons, sits on the north side of Eisenhower Parkway between Middle Georgia State College and Interstate 475. Rooms start at $30.88 a night. A teen who lives there called 911 when she heard gunshots. One of the first officers to arrive wrote in his report that when he got there, he met a man from Sandersville named Douglas Wayne Jackson Jr. Jackson, 34, stated 2 black male subjects attempted to rob him using a handgun, the officer wrote. Mr. Jackson explained he took the firearm from 1 of the suspects. ... Mr. Jackson also advised he shot 1 of the suspects and fired 1 shot at the other suspect who made an escape. It was unclear in the report whether Jackson himself had been armed, or if he fired a gun that belonged to one of the men he said tried to rob him. Alexus Blow, 17, who dialed 911 upon hearing gunfire outside her room and who later identified Washington as the victim, told a reporter the scenario described in the police report didnt seem right. I dont know what happened when they was outside, Blow said. But it couldnt have been like that. Bibb County Coroner Leon Jones said an altercation began in a room and spilled outside. Not long after the shooting, police at the motel had a man in the back of a squad car. Meanwhile, Washingtons body lay under a sheet near the pool. A Macon police news release did not mention that anyone was in custody, but Jacksons second assailant was being sought. They are looking for some suspects, but its still in the early stages of the investigation, Jones said early Monday. When we got here, everything was in turmoil. ... The information that was given to the officers was very sketchy. As of Monday evening, police had not released specifics on the circumstances of Washingtons death. Jones, the coroner, said Washington lived on Evergreen Street in Warner Robins. The police report, however, listed the slain mans address as Feb Avenue, a side street off Macons Holt Avenue, two blocks southeast of Central High School. Some of Washingtons kin showed up at the motel in the predawn darkness. They broke down in tears after learning of his death. They hugged and tried to console one another as the teens body was loaded onto a stretcher. The victims brother did his best to suppress loud sobs and tell himself the news wasnt true. That is not my brother. That is not my brother, he said to himself in the parking lot. Theyre going to find him somewhere else. Jones said family members were so upset they could not remember the victims mothers address. They gave him a phone number instead. Relatives said Washington often visited people at the motel, Jones said. To contact writer Joe Kovac Jr., call 744-4397.
