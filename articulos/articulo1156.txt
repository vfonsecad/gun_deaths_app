1 CITRUS HEIGHTS (CBS13) – CBS13 was an eyewitness to a murder at a Citrus Heights McDonald’s parking lot. CBS13′s Laura Cole and a news photographer happened to be at the fast-food restaurant on Lichen Drive during a dinner break when the shots were fired. Cole was in the back of her news truck working on another story when photojournalist Mike Lowry noticed something going on, which turned out to be the deadly shooting. “There was an older gentleman that was kind of frantic, talking on his phone, pointing off into another direction,” said Lowry. Then McDonald’s employees started talking. “I just heard a pop,” employee Macy Rivas said. Workers didn’t know a shooting occurred until a man rushed inside saying “call 911, someone’s been shot.” The victim was inside a truck. “He told everyone at the front and we just started shaking,” employee Ariel Desoto said. Paramedics tried to save 28-year-old Baron Seidel, but it was too late. Witnesses say the victim’s father was with the victim’s son when the shots rang out. People overhead the victim’s father say his son had been shot in the face. âItâs just unbelievable that it happened,â said Rivas. âThere’s indications that this is an isolated incident, and that the subjects involved possibly knew each other,â said Officer Bryan Fritsch, Citrus Heights Police Department. At this point, investigators don’t believe the shooting was random, but there are still many unanswered questions. Lowry also witnessed who he believes to be the victim’s father remove a box from the truck. Police aren’t saying what was in the box, but it has something to do with the case. Investigators are looking for two suspects in a dark colored sedan, but they don’t have much more than that.
