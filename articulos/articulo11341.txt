Delonta Hendrix, 32, was found unconscious just before midnight Thursday in the 100 block of Pierce Street NW. Officers had been called to the area of 1100 1st Street NW, about a block away, for a report of shots fired. Hendrix was taken to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Officers also found a second man suffering from a gunshot wound to the leg on the same block. A third gunshot victim was found on 1st Street. Police say a fourth victim was driven to the hospital by a friend. Investigators believe the group had been involved in a game of dice when something went wrong and someone opened fire. The injured men are expected to be okay, and police say two masked men are wanted in the shooting. The next morning around noon, a gunshot victim was left at a firestation in the 5300 block of Dix Street NE. An SUV damaged by gunshots was found nearby and the victim was transported to a local hospital with unknown injuries.  Although the shootings are alarming to some, D.C. Police say they're not unusual. "It's been some time since we've seen incidents that occur the way that they have during the last 24 hours," Robert Contee with D.C. Police told News4.
