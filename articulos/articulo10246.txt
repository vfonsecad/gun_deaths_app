1 1 An 18-year-old Riverview man was arrested Sunday morning, accused of orchestrating a drug deal, robbery that went wrong late Saturday night, resulting in a 19-year-old man being fatally shot, authorities said. Charged with first-degree murder Sunday and attempted armed robbery was Garrett Jay Boone, 10426 Hunters Haven Blvd. He remained jailed Sunday afternoon. Bail had not been set. Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies identified the victim as Richard A. Russell, of Soaring Eagle Drive. Deputies said Russell and an unidentified man drove to the area of Early Run Lane and Ravens Nest in the South Pointe development to buy drugs from Boone. According to an arrest affidavit, as Boone approached the vehicle to make the deal, two of his accomplices emerged from the bushes in an attempt to rob Russell and the driver of the car. The driver sped away, and the two gunmen who came out of the dark opened fire, striking Russell in the upper torso. The driver, whose name was not released because he is a witness, found a deputy working off duty at South Pointe Park. The deputy called for an ambulance and provided first aid until paramedics arrived. Russell was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Deputies said Boone admitted to planning and carrying out the armed robbery. The two gunmen have not been arrested. The sheriff's office is asking that anyone with information in the case call (813) 247-8000.
