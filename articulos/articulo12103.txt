Some nearby residents say this area of midtown, especially this apartment building, has had some issues recently. But one neighbor says despite the shooting he still feels safe. âA little on edge. Iâve been living here for quite a few years and you see things every once in a while happeningâ¦St. Patrickâs day, there was a kid who was stabbed over here, but other than that I feel pretty safe here,â said Randall Freese, a midtown resident. Officers have not released the identity of the victim, but say he’s in his 30s. They say the shooting does not appear to be a random and are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.
