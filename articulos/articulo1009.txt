1 A 64-year-old man died on New Year's Eve after he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his guns in his Ravenel home, according to the Charleston County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff's office spokesman Major Jim Brady said 64-year-old Robert Horning succumbed to injuries on Dec. 31, one day after deputies responded to his Drayton Street home to find him laying face down, suffering from a gunshot wound to the forehead. Another man at the home told deputies he heard a gunshot around 3 p.m. and went into the room to find Horning injured. Brady said investigators believe Horning was cleaning his guns when the accident happened. Horning was taken to Medical University of South Carolina before he died. Copyright 2012 WCSC.
