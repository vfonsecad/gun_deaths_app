1 1 NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — A 1-year-old boy has died after being shot in the head Sunday evening in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. As 1010 WINS’ Gene Michaels reported, the shooting happened around 7:20 p.m. on Bristol Street in Brooklyn, police said. The boy — identified as Antiq Hennis of Brooklyn — was in a stroller crossing Livonia Avenue with his parents at the time, authorities and witnesses said. Antiq’s father was pushing him down the sidewalk, when a shot struck the boy in the head. Antiq, who had just turned 1 year old, was rushed to nearby Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, police said. Police confirmed during the 9 p.m. hour that the child had died. Witness Cynthia Ballantyne said she heard the shots, but thought they were firecrackers at first. She said she was glad she did not witness the shooting. Antiq Hennis (credit: handout) âIt was a child. I couldnât watch that. I just get real sad; depressed, and I just came back here. Itâs awful to be killing kids like that â you understand?â she said. âItâs not safe anywhere. Iâm scared to walk the streets right now. Witness Orlando Joseph told CBS 2âs Dave Carlin he saw the boy after the shooting, and the boy did not look like he would survive. “I was in the backyard when I heard the shots. It was like four shots — one after the next â bang, bang bang, bang,â Joseph said. “It was shocking — you think it was a guy or a lady got shot — not a kid. I think it’s pretty messed up.” The outrage over the boyâs death left community activists feeling confident no one will protect the killer and someone will turn him in. They made a direct plea to the gunman. âThey’re making phone calls right, and that shooter guaranteed your name has been picked up at the Police Department, so turn yourself in,” said community activist Tony Herbert. âAn innocent baby slaughtered in the streets of Brownsville â something has to change here. Itâs horrible,â added Bishop Willie Billips. “A young mother and father hurting badly baby — they lost a 1-year-old child.â A memorial is set up outside the home of of Antiq Hennis in Brownsville, Brooklyn.

But one person at the scene said the shooting had nothing to do with the child or his father, and was apparently revenge intended for the boyâs uncle. Police have not confirmed the information. The investigation was ongoing Sunday night.
