Two co-workers from Fresno and Cortez’s father were also injured in the shooting, and all are now stable, Cortez said. Daza is survived by his wife and 1-year-old daughter, who he lived with in Madera, Cortez said. “Quiet, honest, helpful,” Cortez said about his cousin. “You would never see him get mad. He was there for you when you needed him. A great dad.” INITIAL POST: A 23-year-old man was shot dead and three others injured early Sunday morning, according to Sumner Police.
