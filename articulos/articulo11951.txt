1 1 April 7, 2014 MGN Online CLAY COUNTY, Ky. (WKYT) - CLAY CO, Ky. (WKYT) - Neighbors say a woman who routinely checked on the welfare of 59 year old Carl House found the man dead inside his home about 6 oâclock Wednesday night.  âItâs a sad thing, I hate to see death come to anybody,â said neighbor Ben Cupp who says heâs known the victim all his life.   The coroner says House was shot multiple times. He calls it murder.  âItâs in the early stages of the investigation. Weâre saying itâs a death investigation,â said KSP Trooper Lloyd Cochran.  âIt makes you wonder about your neighborhood. Wonder if you could be next,â said Cupp.  Neighbors also say that House had been the victim of an attack in his home last November. They say then he was âleft for deadâ with serious head injuries.  âI came over here that night when the law came over here, he was sitting here, the bloodiest man you ever saw,â said Cupp. Whether the two events are related is not known. House did have some health problems. Most of the time, he lived alone, neighbors said.  âHe was a sick man. Had Lung problems. Lungs were only about 35 to 40% on their own,â said Cupp.  But why heâs deadâ¦at least for now remains a mystery.  Are you surprised UK made it to the  national championship?
