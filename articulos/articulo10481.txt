1 1 77° VICTORVILLE • Tips from the public helped investigators identify and arrest a suspect in the shooting death of Daniel Olivera, according to a Saturday news release from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. Eric David Robbins, 35, was arrested Friday afternoon near his Victorville home on suspicion of murdering Olivera, who was shot to death Aug. 11. Jail records show Robbins was arrested in the area of Brucite Road and Copper Street, about three miles from the ampm convenience store at 15730 Roy Rogers Drive where the shooting took place. About an hour before Olivera's death, a man was seen on store surveillance video arguing with a security guard. Sheriff's officials believe Robbins is the man in the video, and detectives have collected evidence linking him to the shooting. Olivera, a 26-year-old father of four, had just finished his shift as a clerk at the store and was talking to the security guard when he suddenly fell to the ground just before 10:40 p.m. Witnesses reported hearing a popping sound before Olivera fell, but no one reported seeing anyone with a gun at the location. The sheriff's department released the video Thursday and asked for the public's help, while ARCO offered a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading to the arrest of a suspect. Tips led investigators to Robbins. Deputies arrested him, then served a search warrant at Robbins’ residence and "obtained further evidence," according to the news release. Robbins was booked into the West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga without bail on suspicion of murder on Friday at 7 p.m., jail records show. His arraignment is set for Aug. 27 at the Victorville courthouse, according to jail records. Olivera's aunt, Irene Vega, told the Daily Press that a sniper rifle had been found among Robbins' belongings, but on Saturday afternoon sheriff's officials could not confirm that any weapons had been found. Electronic court records do not show any previous criminal cases against Robbins in San Bernardino County. The investigation is still ongoing and anyone with information should call Detective Matthew Peterson or Sergeant Chris Fisher at 909-387-3589.
