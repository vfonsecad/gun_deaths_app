1 1 What was first reported to Beeville police as a possible stabbing turned out to be a shooting that proved fatal Sunday afternoon, and police have arrested the suspected shooter.It was just after 3 p.m. when the Beeville Police Department was called out to the 1100 block of West Huntington, in the area of Nopal Park. It was reported that a man was down and possibly stabbed, but when they arrived they found that he had been shot in the stomach.That man, Alex Longoria, was rushed to Christus Spohn Hospital in Beeville, where he later died from the gunshot wound.According to police, they were informed that Alex Longoria had met with a man named Richard Longoria, no relation, to settle a personal dispute. Richard arrived with a rifle and allegedly shot Alex in the stomach.Richard Longoria was arrested and charged with murder and unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon. His bond was set at $1.5 million for the murder charge, and an additional $500,000 for the unlawful possession charge. Longoria's mother, Veronica Wade, said she is not sure what happened, but she is having a hard time believing that her son did it. She said that as soon as her son found out they were looking for him, he called the police to tell them where he was. "I just don't know nothing," Wade said. "All I know, they are harassing us. They are shooting by the house, broke into my cousin's apartment. They broke the door to the trailer. I just wish it would all stop. I wish it was all a bad dream." Police have not confirmed whether or not they have found the murder weapon, and they are still looking for a 90s model silver Camaro that was possibly involved in the incident. It had black racing stripes, black rims and dual exhaust.
