1 A Cheatham County man was arrested Tuesday after his wife was shot to death inside their Trouble Road home.          Investigators said Carl Johnson, 74, got into a fight with his 73-year-old wife, Grace.         When deputies got to their home on Trouble Road around 1 p.m., they found the man's wife with a single gunshot wound to the chest.        Officials said Johnson admitted to the crime.  "Being both parties are 73 and 74 years old and having been married for 56 years it's definitely a unique case," said investigator Dale Smith.Â   Wednesday in court Johnson seemed apathetic and yawned several times.  He's never been in trouble before, though in July police brought Johnson in for a mental evaluation after he fired shots inside his home. "His biggest concern at the moment is that the family is upset with him," said Smith.  The family was inside the couple's home on Wednesday, but was not ready to comment. They told investigators they think Johnson has Alzheimer's disease and that may be to blame.  Copyright WSMV 2012 (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.
