"It doesn't make sense," his grieving daughter told NBC 4 New York Tuesday. "He didn't have any enemies. He wasn't a street person. I don't know how this could have happened."  The motive was not known. A law enforcement official says nothing appears to be missing, and his wallet was still on him. The victim, identified as Paul Setteducato, was a real estate manager doing rounds collecting rent in East Flatbush when he was gunned down. He was found at about 6:20 p.m. Investigators believe he was shot once in the abdomen while in his Mercedes Benz, and was shot in the shoulder and head after he stumbled out. The keys were found in the ignition, and the car was off. The passenger door was open.  Setteducato was found outside the car on Erasmus Street, clutching a pen in his right hand, with his cell phone near his body. A longtime friend who showed up at his home Tuesday was stunned.  "It's shocking," he said. "He's not a guy -- there was no illegitimacy of any sort. It's impossible." Paul Setteducato and his wife of 37 years, Susan, lived in a Midwood home where they had raised two daughters. Janine Setteducato said she can't bring herself to tell her youngest daughter that her grandfather is gone. "I know he lived the life he wanted to live, but he left my mother and now she's all alone," she said in tears.  "I'll always love my father. I'll never forget. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be who I am today."
