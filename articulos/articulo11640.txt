1 1 Family and friends remembered the man that was shot 12 times, with a candlelight vigil Sunday night. Candles were lit during the remembrance for 31-year-old William Brown. The vigil was held on Rockdale Drive. Brown was shot a dozen times Saturday evening near the intersection of Dr. Moton Street and Smith-Robinson Road. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday.  Jackson police say the shooting is under investigation. As of Sunday night, the shooter was on the run.  Now, police and Brown's family are begging for the public's help. "He's a good person. He has a great heart. He'd give you his last dime if he could, but no one has come up to speak on his behalf. And I know that street he was killed on always has someone outside. Someone is always watching," said Deundra Brown, the victim's wife. If you have any information that might help police arrest Brown's killer, you're asked to call Crime Stoppers.  Copyright 2013 MSNewsNow.
