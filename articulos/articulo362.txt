1 Posted on Jan 23, 2013 Daily Press | Photo from inlandpolitics.com A local union president is dead after an apparent suicide following charges he engaged in lewd acts with a minor. Clarence Sanchez, 60, was found by a family member at a residence in the 27000 block of Azurite Road in Barstow on Monday afternoon. He had suffered an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to Cindy Bachman, spokeswoman with the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department, on Tuesday. Sanchez was the president of the American Federation of Government Employees at the Marine Corps Logistics Base, Reina Barnett, public affairs chief with the MCLB, said. Sheriff’s deputies arrested Sanchez on Sunday after issuing a search warrant and following an investigation that he engaged in lewd acts with a child under 14 or 15 years old. Sanchez was booked in to the county jail in Barstow and later released on $25,000 bail only hours before he was found dead. The AFGE is âthe largest federal employee union, representing 650,000 federal and Washington, D.C., government workers nationwide and overseasâ and has 1,100 local chapters, according to its website. The apparent suicide comes on the heels of last week’s death of Aaron Antill, who was involved in a similar legal case. Read More By Shea Johnson, www.Newscaller.com You may also like ...
