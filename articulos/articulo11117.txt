According to officers on the scene, witnesses saw a white GMC Yukon or Chevy Suburban speeding away on St. Louis Avenue.  Two or three people may have been inside. One thing was certain; at least 16 shell casings were all over the rear parking lot of Denese’s Place.  The nightclub is on Collinsville Avenue near St. Louis Avenue and just a couple of blocks from the police station. Officers rushed to the nightclub just after 11:30pm Sunday.  Police said there were at least 50 people in the parking lot at the time of the shooting.  They also said the victim’s family rushed to the scene, once word of the attack spread.
