Baldwin County Coroner, John Gonzalez, says the victims are 22-year-old Jalisa Scott, and Travis Anderson, both of Baldwin County. According to Baldwin County Captain Brad King, a call came into the sheriff's office before noon on Monday. Scott was found shot multiple times with a gunshot wound to the head. She was inside her home at the Georgetown Village Apartments on Highway 49. Anderson was also inside. He had a single gun-shot wound to the head. King named Anderson as the shooter. He says it appears the two had a relationship. He called the tragedy a "domestic situation that's gone horribly wrong." Gonzalez says Anderson died on the scene. Scott was taken to the Oconee Regional Medical Center where she died. Scott's body was sent to the GBI crime lab for an autopsy. This is still an open investigation.
