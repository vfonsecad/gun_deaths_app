From staff reportsAugust 23, 2013                                                          DURHAM — Sheriffs deputies are investigating the shooting death of a man who entered a home at 307 Stoney Creek Circle early Friday morning. Sheriffs department spokesman Paul Sherwin said the man was shot and killed during an altercation inside the home, which was occupied by four people. Sheriffs investigators are looking for the man they think fired the fatal shot, who left the home before deputies arrived. They identified him as Carlos Hernandez, who is in his early to mid-40s and who may be driving a small, red sedan, Sherwin said. The dead man was known to the people in the home, Sherwin said. Deputies have not released his name. Deputies were sent to the home off South Mineral Springs Road at 1:37 a.m., Sherwin said. The sheriffs departments asks anyone with information to call the Investigations Division at 919-560-0880 or the sheriffs crime tip line at 919-560-7151.
