1 1 April 7, 2014 A Washington man, who was wanted for more than a year by local authorities on assault charges, was shot and killed by deputies in Richland County, South Carolina on Monday. The Richland County coroner this afternoon confirmed the identity of the man killed as Mitch St. Clair, Jr.   The 39-year-old St. Clair was shot late Monday after a short chase outside of Columbia.  Authorities say the man exited the vehicle and fired multiple shots at a deputy who returned fire. Deputies say at the time St. Clair was carrying someone else's ID card. St. Clair is the son of Mitch St. Clair, Sr. who owns a Washington trucking company and is a current member of the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission. In May 2012, Beaufort County deputies say the younger St. Clair assaulted a woman and a child on Whichards Beach Road.   St. Clair was wanted for assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, second degree kidnapping, assault inflicting serious bodily injury, possession of a firearm by felon, assault on a child under 12, assault by pointing a gun, assault with a deadly weapon with a minor present and communicating threats. The South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division continues to investigate this officer-involved shooting.
