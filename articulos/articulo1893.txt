(WTVR) -A Chesterfield Police officer shot and killed a man during an early morning altercation, according to Chesterfield Police Lt. Wes Fertig. Police said the officer saw a car pulled off on the side of the southbound ramp on Chippenham Parkway just off the Hull Street Road exit around 3:00 a.m. “The officer stopped at what he thought was a disabled vehicle,” Chesterfield Police Capt. Chris Hensley said. “Upon contact with that suspect, he found out he had just been involved in a grand larceny.” The suspect, identified as 45-year-old Frankie Pitt, was accused of stealing a cash drawer just 10 minutes earlier. Authorities say the officer attempted to arrest Pitt, but Pitt resisted. During the altercation, Lt. Fertig said the officer fired his gun, killing Pitt. The police officer was treated at a local hospital and suffered minor, non-life threatening injuries. The officer will be placed on desk duty pending a routine investigation. The ramp will be closed Sunday morning as police investigate the shooting. If anyone has any information, please contact the Chesterfield Police Department at 804-748-1251. This is a developing story.  Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on CBS 6!
