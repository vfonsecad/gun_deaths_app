A 29-year-old man was shot to death on a North Philadelphia playground Monday night.Â  Police said they were called to the Eric "Hank" Gathers Jr. Memorial Recreation Center's playground, on Diamond Street near 25th, shortly after 8 p.m. for the report of a shooting. When they arrived, they found Tyreese Hardy, of Gratz Street near Cumberland, lying on the pavement inside the playground suffering from several gunshot wounds to the chest and back. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 8:44 p.m.Â  About an hour later, police cordoned off the block and neighbors looked on as crime-scene unit investigators and detectives combed the scene. Hardy lay covered with a white sheet just inside the playground's fence, about 20 feet from a children's jungle gym with a green sliding board. Police reported no suspects or arrests.
