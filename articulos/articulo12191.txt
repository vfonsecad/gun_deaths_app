1 1   			 90° F A fight that began inside an Ocala bar turned deadly when it spilled into a nearby apartment complex with gunfire, killing two people. The victims have not been identified, said Judge Cochran, a Marion County Sheriff's Office spokesman. Detectives think that just after midnight, two victims were followed by two other individuals from the bar to the 4700 block of Northeast 32nd Lane. Cochran said tires were slashed, car windows were broken and the warring parties pulled out weapons — a knife versus a gun. Authorities did not say whether any suspects were in custody. Detectives are interviewing witnesses and asking anyone with information about the shooting to call Crime Stoppers of Marion County at 352-368-7867. arehernandez@tribune.com or 407-420-5471 or @ahernandez_OS
