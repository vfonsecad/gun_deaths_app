According to police reports, the woman left, but came back around 3 a.m. with her mother, father and a friend. The family began "pounding on the door" to Brown's home.Â  An altercation between 48-year-old Darrell Johnson and Derrick Brown, 21, ensued, in which Johnson beat Brown with a club repeatedly. The fight was broken up by the friend. Â  Johnson, of Covington, and his daughter then left the scene to retrieve some clothing. The place was trashed by the time the pair left, according to police. When they came downstairs, Johnson began to beat Brown with a metal barbell, fracturing Brown's elbow. Brown then drew a handgun from his pajama pocket and fired once at Mr. Johnson. "When Johnson continued to approach Brown, he fired another shot at him," according to police.
