1 1 Indianapolis Metro Police shot and killed a carjacking suspect in an alley near the 2700 block of Barth and Manker, south of Garfield Park early Friday morning. The man was identified as Brent Walls, 21, of Indianapolis. His family has been notified. Police say at approximately 1:30 a.m. a woman was unloading groceries in her driveway in the 2500 block of Shelby when a man approached and tried to rob her and take her car. She resisted, and he fired a shot through her car window before running away. "He was smaller than me," said victim Cassidy Frye. Police set up a perimeter and a K-9 located the suspected carjacker hiding under a trash pile around 2:30 a.m.  The suspect was ordered to surrender but did not comply. After the K-9 unit was sent in and attempting to make apprehension, the suspect pointed a gun at an officer.  The officer shot and killed the suspect. Police called the 21-year-old desperate and dangerous. "That's why we had to make sure we found him tonight and, unfortunately, he made a bad decision and it cost him his life," said IMPD Lt. Chris Bailey. Department of Correction records show Walls spent more than two of the past four years in jail or prison. In June, his father, Charles Walls, was shot to death. His murder remains unsolved. On the street where the family lived, neighbors say Brent Walls frequently fell into trouble, but treated them well. "He had to be on drugs. That's not the Brent I know. He had to be on drugs or something, because the Brent I knew would have given himself up," said neighbor Kathy Barnard. Walls was the second man to die during an attempted IMPD arrest within eight hours. A drug suspect died on the northeast side Thursday night during an altercation with IMPD officers.
