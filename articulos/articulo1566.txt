1 1 One man is dead after a standoff with authorities in Jackson County. Jackson County Sheriff's deputies responded to the house on County Road 48 around midnight Monday for a shots fired call. Investigators said 31-year-old Jeremy Gregory of Section barricaded himself inside the home. He had a rifle pointed at officers, so they backed off. That's when investigators said Gregory started shooting in their direction. They tried to negotiate for hours. Around 3:45 a.m. Tuesday , Jackson County authorities contacted Madison County SWAT team for help. When the SWAT team arrived, they threw tear gas in the house, but Gregory fired back at them.  Officers returned fire, killing Gregory. The Alabama Bureau of investigation has been notified and is investigating, as is standard with officer-involved shootings. No one else was inside the house at the time of the incident, and no officers were injured. Copyright 2013, WAFF.
