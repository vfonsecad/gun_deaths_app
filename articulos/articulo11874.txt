1 1 Monday, April  7, 2014 People across the nation (and in several other countries) are posting videos of themselves jumping into frigid water to show support for a 5-month-old northwest Missouri boy who is battling cancer. Landon Shaw, of rural Tarkio is battling a rare cancer that first hit his kidney and now is in his brain. His family is on Medicaid, which wont cover all of the costs coming in. Someone shot a driver in the leg near Interstate 435 and Interstate 470 Sunday night in Kansas City — the 13th such shooting at a motorist in the area within a month. Ten of the shootings have occurred in Kansas City since March 8, with single shootings occurring in Leawood, Blue Springs and Lee’s Summit. Three drivers have been hurt in the shootings, but no one has been killed. A day after sparking a bullpen meltdown, Royals relievers Tim Collins and Francisley Bueno were both placed on the 15-day disabled list. Collins is suffering from a flexor strain in his left elbow. Bueno sustained a sprain and bone bruise in his left little finger. The coach was saying that college athletes in the programs that produce revenue should receive more than a scholarship. He swore he believed this, that as many opportunities are given to scholarship athletes  exposure, no debt, tutors  an industry with enough money to pay coaches millions while the talent is prohibited from getting much more than room and board just didnt feel right. I figured Id test him. For Money Smart Month, the Federal Reserve Bank will host a series of more than 200 seminars, workshops and other events in the metro area to get peoples attention about their bad money habits. On Sunday, financial planner Andres Gutierrez, aka El Machete, was the featured speaker at the Financial FunFest at Sporting Park. Several projects discussed at streetcar development discussion held by local Urban Land Institute, but even most optimistic developer says plenty of parking will still be needed for foreseeable future. Theyve been happily dating for a few years and the question keeps coming up: When are you getting married? At first it was the usual friends and family. But now its everyone from co-workers and church ladies to random acquaintances. They dont understand the weight of this invasive question. Basically, they are saying, When is your man going to put a ring on it? The constant prying is laced with judgment. Never Have I Ever: My Life (So Far) Without a Date, 27-year-old Katie Heaney's frank and funny new memoir, makes a good case for staying single. Nara Schoenberg of the Chicago Tribune caught up with Heaney, now 27, dating a bit more and working as an editor at BuzzFeed, for a phone interview about life, love and the response to her first book. George Strait won his second entertainer of the year — 25 years after he won his first — and Miranda Lambert and Keith Urban teamed up to earn top honors Sunday night at a jam-packed Academy of Country Music Awards that had a little something for everyone. Mickey Rooney, the irrepressible actor of seemingly limitless skills who personified the all-American teenager in movie musicals with Judy Garland and dozens of other comedies and dramas, has died at 93. Rooney, once among the worlds top box-office stars, could sing, dance, play drums and do pratfalls and impersonations. He began his career at 15 months in his parents' vaudeville act and never really retired. As fun or silly as the online game to find America’s worst parking craters might seem, it has a serious purpose: Get cities to look at the problems they have created by dedicating so much space to parking los in downtown rather than more productive activities, such as residential towers or office buildings. Even before a weekend of late nights and frayed nerves, Kansas lawmakers were in the throes of agony. They needed to find $129 million to correct unconstitutional school funding inequities. But thanks to a self-inflicted budget crisis with no end in sight, the road to $129 million was paved only with brutal choices. See the full forecast on The Star's weather page.

Kuether, 30, was shot once in the abdomen shortly before 7 p.m. at the Super 6 Plus at 4142 S. Noland Road, according to documents filed in Jackson County Circuit Court. As many as eight people were in the room when the shooting occurred. According to the court documents, witnesses told police that Krepps was there to do tattoo work on some of those present when he suddenly stood up, looked at Kuether, and asked, “What did you just say?” According to the documents, Krepps then pulled out a chrome revolver and fired one shot at Kuether. One woman told police detectives that she had just asked someone for a cigarette and Kuether said he had one. That was when Krepps asked the question of Kuether and then shot him, according to the documents. Krepps fled on foot after the shooting. A short time later, police officers stopped him near 31st Street and Crysler Avenue. Officers said Krepps did not have a gun on him when he was arrested. Bond was set at $150,000.
