Seventeen-year-old boy Lavanial Williams was gunned down in the middle of the night. 	    "I was at home asleep, and all of a sudden, I heard a couple shots, you know -- boom boom-- and then it woke me up," said neighbor Royce McElmore.

The victim's sister, April, tells ABC7 News her brother was a good kid who turned 17-years-old four days ago. He recently came to this public housing complex to live with his mom after moving from his father's home in the Northern California town of Weed. He didn't know anyone here and being new to the neighborhood could have made him a target.   April, "We're not from out here. When you're not from out here, and you walk around, it's not okay. It's not okay. Being a guy, you have it worse than the girls," said April.   Neighbors think the teen was at the wrong place at the wrong time. His family had been attacked before.   "I worked with his family last year -- people shot into their home and had terrified the family and I had worked with them to try to get them a transfer out of Marin City," said McElmore.
