1 1 Monday, April  7, 2014 People across the nation (and in several other countries) are posting videos of themselves jumping into frigid water to show support for a 5-month-old northwest Missouri boy who is battling cancer. Landon Shaw, of rural Tarkio is battling a rare cancer that first hit his kidney and now is in his brain. His family is on Medicaid, which wont cover all of the costs coming in. Someone shot a driver in the leg near Interstate 435 and Interstate 470 Sunday night in Kansas City — the 13th such shooting at a motorist in the area within a month. Ten of the shootings have occurred in Kansas City since March 8, with single shootings occurring in Leawood, Blue Springs and Lee’s Summit. Three drivers have been hurt in the shootings, but no one has been killed. The coach was saying that college athletes in the programs that produce revenue should receive more than a scholarship. He swore he believed this, that as many opportunities are given to scholarship athletes  exposure, no debt, tutors  an industry with enough money to pay coaches millions while the talent is prohibited from getting much more than room and board just didnt feel right. I figured Id test him. Its not supposed to happen this way, winning an NCAA title with a team of freshmen. But Kentucky has a chance to do just that Monday night when the Wildcats play Connecticut for the championship. The program magnifies one of the college basketballs biggest issues, something it is powerless to control. Because the very best amateurs cannot turn professional until they are 19 years old, college becomes a pit stop on the way to the NBA. For Money Smart Month, the Federal Reserve Bank will host a series of more than 200 seminars, workshops and other events in the metro area to get peoples attention about their bad money habits. On Sunday, financial planner Andres Gutierrez, aka El Machete, was the featured speaker at the Financial FunFest at Sporting Park. Michael Dorsey succeeds Fleury Yelvington who resigned last month. Dorsey has served as chief operating officer of Carondelet and chief executive officer of St. Joseph Medical Center for about five years. Never Have I Ever: My Life (So Far) Without a Date, 27-year-old Katie Heaney's frank and funny new memoir, makes a good case for staying single. Nara Schoenberg of the Chicago Tribune caught up with Heaney, now 27, dating a bit more and working as an editor at BuzzFeed, for a phone interview about life, love and the response to her first book.  DEAR ABBY: My mother committed suicide when I was a child. She was severely depressed, and although she sought professional help, the worst happened. George Strait won his second entertainer of the year — 25 years after he won his first — and Miranda Lambert and Keith Urban teamed up to earn top honors Sunday night at a jam-packed Academy of Country Music Awards that had a little something for everyone. Mickey Rooney, the irrepressible actor of seemingly limitless skills who personified the all-American teenager in movie musicals with Judy Garland and dozens of other comedies and dramas, has died at 93. Rooney, once among the worlds top box-office stars, could sing, dance, play drums and do pratfalls and impersonations. He began his career at 15 months in his parents' vaudeville act and never really retired. Even before a weekend of late nights and frayed nerves, Kansas lawmakers were in the throes of agony. They needed to find $129 million to correct unconstitutional school funding inequities. But thanks to a self-inflicted budget crisis with no end in sight, the road to $129 million was paved only with brutal choices. What stands out in a visit to Guatemala are the hardworking, gracious people who endured a 36-year civil war claiming more than 200,000 lives and displacing even more before it ended in 1996. With more education, fewer children to raise and more time, Guatemalans will widen todays narrow paths into opportunities and new ways to improve the country.

A Super Bowl party fueled by tequila and marijuana ended with an apparently accidental gunshot to the back of one revelers head.              	The Platte County prosecutors office filed charges Monday against 34-year-old Joshua W. Bailey, who was the host of the party at his apartment in the 4800 block of Northwest Homestead Road in Riverside.  Joshua Anderson, 22, of Riverside, was killed. According to court documents, Bailey called 911 at 8:28 p.m. Sunday to report that he had accidentally shot his friend. Bailey said he did not know there was a bullet in the chamber.  Im going to jail, Bailey told the dispatcher. When police arrived, they found Bailey in the yard and Anderson inside on the floor, in a pool of blood, gasping for air. He was taken to a hospital, where he died about two hours later. Bailey allegedly told police he had had four or five shots of tequila and smoked marijuana before taking a Jimenez 9 mm semi-automatic handgun out of a shoe box to show to his guests. Bailey allegedly said he emptied the gun and then put a magazine of ammunition in it and hit the slide release to make the slide go forward. This action chambered a round, according to a police statement filed in court. Bailey did not think there was a round in the chamber. According to police, Bailey then got up from the couch and pulled the trigger. The bullet struck Anderson in the back of the head. Bailey told police he had not aimed at his friend but the gun must have been pointed in that direction. Police think the shooting was accidental. However, Bailey is a convicted felon who is not allowed to possess a firearm. He was charged with that in addition to unlawfully discharging a firearm while intoxicated, involuntary manslaughter and armed criminal action.  If convicted, he could face up to 21 years in prison. A cash bond was set at $500,000. Bailey was in the Platte County Jail on Monday. In a written statement, county Prosecutor Eric Zahnd said the incident had nothing to do with gun rights or gun control. But virtually everyone agrees that only law-abiding citizens should safely and responsibly possess firearms, Zahnd said.
