While relatives told police there have been instances of domestic strife, investigators say there is no record that police were ever called to the Smith household since they moved to Indiana about 18 months ago. But at 6 a.m. Thursday, police said, Fredrick Smith, 43, shot and killed his wife in their bedroom at 1052 Harrison St. Her daughter, Alana, 17,  told police she heard her mother and stepfather aruging, then one gunshot. She gathered her four younger half-siblings and ushered them outside to safety at a neighbor’s house, police spokeswoman Cpl. Gabrielle King said. She returned to the house and asked Smith, “What did you do?” and he responded by pointing the gun at his head and firing. Both Fredrick and Smith were dead when police arrived. When Patrolmen Steven Peek, Daniel Perryman, Justin Hedrick and Phillip Komisarcik arrived, they found the teen in the street, screaming, King said. Investigators recovered the weapon and said it was clearly a homicide-suicide. The children are with Alicia Smith’s relatives, police said. Detective Alex Jones investigated the case. The Smiths first lived in Lakeshore Dunes apartments in Miller when they arrived in Indiana, but moved to the rental home on Harrison Street in June. The property owner could not be reached for comment.
