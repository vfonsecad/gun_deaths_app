1 1 MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — Police are investigating after a man’s body was found slumped over outside a building in Shoreview, Minn.  Authorities say the man was found around 6:40 a.m. Thursday on the 5700 block of Hamline Avenue North. The area has been blocked off from traffic while police investigate the scene.  Police say it appears the man died of a gunshot wound. Officials say someone saw the man Wednesday morning and thought he passed out on the street so they called the cops.  The victim is described as a black man in his late 20s or early 30s. Police say he didn’t have any identification on him.  Authorities initially thought it was a suicide but now say they will continue to investigate it as a suspicious death to ensure it was not made to look intentional by someone else.  “We are in the information gathering stage at this time,” Sheriff Matt Bostrom stated in a press release. “If anyone saw something suspicious, such as a vehicle or activity in the area last night or early this morning, I encourage them to call 651-767-0640 and share what you know to assist our investigation.” The Ramsey County Sheriff’s Department is handling the investigation, with the assistance of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s Office. Police say this appears to be an isolated incident and there is no threat to the neighboring community.
