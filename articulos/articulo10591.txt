(credit: Mike Campbell/WWJ Newsradio 950) DETROIT (WWJ) – Detroit policeÂ have their hands full after moreÂ than half a dozen shootings took placeÂ overnight — three of them fatal. One of the fatal shootings took place at a home in theÂ 7300 block of Stahelin, just north of Warren andÂ west of the Southfield FreewayÂ on the city’s west side. Police arrived at the brick bungalow early Friday morningÂ to find a middle-aged man dead in the basement. It appears he was killed by a single gunshot wound. People claiming to be relatives of the resident say the victim was visiting the house when something went wrong. Reporting live from the scene, WWJ’s Mike Campbell said he watched as police investigators removed two assault rifles from the home. It wasn’t immediately clear, however, if one of those guns is the murder weapon. Another man was shot and killedÂ in the 14000 block ofÂ Wyoming,Â just north ofÂ I-96 on the city’s west side, during an attempted robbery. Yet another man was killed at Crane and Kerchavel streets, near the city’sÂ Indian Village neighborhoodÂ on the east side, after an apparent dispute at a houseÂ party. No arrests have been made in any of the cases. Police say at least four other non-fatal shootings occurred since 11 p.m. Thursday. Investigations are ongoing.
