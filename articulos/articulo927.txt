1 A man shot and killed himself after a six-hour standoff with police in Robertson County early Saturday. Springfield's police chief tells Channel 4 Kevin Hudson held his ex-girlfriend at gunpoint at his home on RW Gordon Drive after the woman came to pick up Christmas gifts for her son. Authorities say the man put a gun to the woman's chin and held her in the car for an hour. He later forced the woman inside the house and threatened to kill her and the son if she left. Chief David Thompson says she was let go after about two hours and officers responded to the home with a warrant for Hudson's arrest. Police made contact with the man around 3 a.m. Saturday and spent hours trying to talk the man out of hurting himself. Thompson says Hudson fired four shots at officers, but no one was hurt. Police did not return fire, but did attempt to use a Taser. SWAT team members ultimately fired tear gas through the window around 9:30 a.m. Police say Hudson fatally shot himself inside the home. Officers believe he had been using cocaine heavily the day before. Copyright 2012 WSMV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.
