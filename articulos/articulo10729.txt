(AP)  Authorities say three men have died in a pair of shootings in a violence-plagued Philadelphia-area city.     Police told the Delaware County Daily Times (http://bit.ly/154WXJX ) that officers were sent to an area in Chester after reports of gunfire at 11:30 p.m. Monday.     Capt. Anita Amaro said they found two men shot in the back. An 18-year-old died at the scene and a 22-year-old was pronounced dead at Crozer-Chester Medical Center.     Shortly after midnight, police responded to another reported shooting and found a 20-year-old man shot in the head while driving a car, which then struck several parked cars.     He was taken to the hospital, where authorities say he died.     Police say it's unclear whether the shootings were related. Fourteen people have been killed in the city so far this year.     ___Information from: Delaware County Daily Times, http://www.delcotimes.com                     Copyright © Daily Local News                  Copyright notice                  Privacy Policy                  Site Map                  21st Century Media
