Looked like two or three, maybe four people inside,â Randy Brooks Sr. said outside his sonâs mobile home a few hours, after his son died at Medical Center Hospital. Initially, he said, neighbors mistook gunfire for firecrackers. Randy Brooks Sr. and his sonâs cousin Scott Warren said they couldnât imagine why someone would kill their loved one, a 37-year-old U.S. Navy veteran. âHe was always an upbeat, good guy,â Warren said. âHe was very giving.â By late Saturday night, the Ector County Sheriffâs Office had yet to release many details about the case. The investigation was ongoing, spokesman Sgt. Gary Duesler said in an email, and no suspects were in custody. Deputies first responded to a report of shots fired at about 4:16 p.m. at 7323 Kentucky Ave. Public records show Randy Ray Brooks Jr. lived at the home, and deputies confirmed late Saturday night that he was the victim. Brooks was listed in critical condition Saturday evening before he died at 6:55 p.m. Sgt. Gary Duesler said by email Saturday evening said investigators believe the man was alone in the residence when the shooting happened, but did not elaborate.Â  At the scene Saturday afternoon, officers with the Criminal Investigation Division were seen documenting evidence, and investigators were talking to neighbors. Randy Brooks Sr. said he went to the hospital to see his son, but he died before he got the chance. Warren said hospital officials told him Randy Brooks Jr. suffered a gunshot wound to the back of his head. The Sheriffâs office had not commented on the injuries or the number of shots fired. Randy Brooks Sr. said his son got out of the Navy a few years ago and held a variety of jobs, including a stint as a trucker. Warren said his cousin most recently worked a casing job in the oilfield.
