(WTXL)--"I'm just shocked because it happened so close to home you just never expect to see something like this happening right in front of my mother's house," said Thomasville resident Safira White. Tense moments, inside this medical clinic where police say a gunman opened fire, trying to kill his wife. Across the street resident Safira White were getting ready for work. "When I came out I heard somebody screaming help me, help me, and by the time I walked up to the corner, he was already laid out in front of the building dead," said White. It happened shortly after seven Wednesday morning. That's when Thomasville Police Lt. Eric Hampton says Leonard Threadcraft pulled up in this car to this daycare center right across the street, that his wife Loretha Threadcraft runs. Lt. Hampton says he showed her his gun. Moments later, Loretha fled across the street to the Southwest Georgia Dialysis center and barricaded herself in the bathroom. Her husband Leonard Threadcraft reportedly then fired two shots towards the bathroom, then walked outside and killed himself. Neighbor Nadine Jackson says she heard gun shots and she still can't believe it happened just steps away from her home. "It was kind of strange for me to get up in the morning and see somebody dead laying across the street from your house." said Jackson. Jackson says she's just thankful Loretha and no patients were harmed during those frightening moments.
