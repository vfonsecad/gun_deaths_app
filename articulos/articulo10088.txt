1 1 ST. GEORGE â€” A husband and wife were found dead in their St. George house Monday.   A firearm was believed to be involved with both deaths, according to St. George police. Although investigators were not publicly calling it a murder-suicide Monday, they said they did not believe there were any outstanding suspects.   "The incident is contained to that residence," said St. George Police Sgt. Sam Despain.   Neighbors say the bodies of Paul Day, 60, and Mary Ann Day, 47, were found in their home, near 2000 East and 200 South, just after 9 a.m. by their 18-year-old son.   "We're all really quite shocked this had to happen," said neighbor Tim Gee.   Gee said he didn't know of any domestic problems with the couple and even saw them out walking together Sunday night.   "They were holding hands and talking, and I didn't see anything wrong," he said. "They just seemed to be very nice people who were always willing to help others."   Gee said his son heard something that sounded like fireworks about 2 a.m. but didn't think much of it. The neighborhood was in shock Monday, he said, adding that the couple was considered to be friendly and the type of people who were always willing to help out their neighbors when needed.
