1 Clayton County police went door-to-door at Brookview Village Condos in Riverdale. They were looking for leads in the death of a taxi driver. Officers said the driver was found shot in the head in his cab earlier Friday morning. Family of the cab driver confirm he is Rosendo Casarrubias, 44, with EVAS Taxi. He took care of his 16-year-old daughter, and was working to bring his wife and other daughter to the U.S. from Mexico. "Hardworking, very honest. He didn't like people who were hanging out and not doing much. He worked day and night," said friend Mirna Velez, through an interpreter. Velez said Casarrubias was always careful about where he drove, especially at night. Marbella Garcia is a taxi driver with Reyes Taxi and drove through the neighborhood on Friday. She's scared because of what happened to her friend last night.  "Yesterday he was alive, he had life, but today he passed away. That is impossible. I don't know what is going on," Garcia said.  Bobby Bowman Jr. said his sister noticed the cab in front of her house.  "She said she started to call the police because somebody was sitting out there so long, but she didn't call. She feels bad because she probably could have saved his life or something because she didn't know what was going on in front of her door," Bowman said.  It's not clear if the taxi driver was picking up or dropping someone off last night.  "I saw the cab come down through last night between 11 p.m. and midnight. All I saw was a black cab with the little thing on top," said Brandon Halcomb, who lives nearby. Investigators went door-to-door Friday looking for witnesses and clues. Garcia said what happened to her friend is a cab driver's worst nightmare.  "It's too danger more in the nighttime," Garcia said. Copyright 2013 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation). All rights reserved.
