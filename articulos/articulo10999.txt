The victim was found at 9:02 p.m. in the street at Connecticut Avenue and  Prest Street, suffering from gunshot wounds and was rushed to an area  hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 11 p.m. He has been identified as Jesus Pinero, whose last known address was in Norwich. One resident reported hearing seven to eight gunshots. "I heard a few pops and then I heard "Ahhh," Terra Smith, of New London, reports. An officer rushed to Pinero's side. "He was moaning that he was in pain and the police officer was comforting him, telling him to lie down, not to move," Smith said. Pinero was transported to a nearby hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. Police do not think this was a random act of violence and said they believe the victim was targeted. "It was very silent. There wasn't any yelling or screaming. It was just a very seemingly calculated hit, it didn't seem random," Smith said. Police blocked off an area around the size of two city blocks and towed away an SUV with New Hampshire license plates. A Jeep with bullet holes was left at the scene. Police said they believe Pinero knew the shooter and was the intended target. Police ask anyone with information about the fatal shooting to come forward and call the New London Police Department, Investigations Division at 860-447-1481. All calls are confidential.
