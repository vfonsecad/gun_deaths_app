Conway police went to Hemingway Street at 3:30 p.m. Thursday after receiving a call of shots being fired, according to a press release. Thursday evening Conway police were calling the incident a traffic investigation, without any hint of suspecting foul play. Capt. Tammy Carter with Conway police said Friday, however, that it was always a homicide. She said police responded for the shots fired and while crews were responding, the crash was reported. On scene, police found a Dodge truck crashed into a home on the adjacent Taylor Square and the driver, Dwayne Gaghum, 53, with a single gunshot wound to the head, according to a press release. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Carter said via email it appears Gaghum was the intended target of the gunshots, and wasn’t simply driving through the area as the shots were fired. A mother and two children were living in the home, which was condemned Thursday night because of structural damage received during the crash, Carter said. The American Red Cross stepped in to assist the family, she said. No suspects or a motive for the shooting were identified. The case remains under investigation and police hope to have more details soon. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Conway Police Department at 248-1790.
