1 1  A 51-year-old man apparently shot and killed himself after starting a fire inside his St. Petersburg home Friday morning, police detectives said.  About 7 a.m., firefighters responded to the house fire at 8074 23rd St. N., police said.   Firefighters found the fire was confined to the home’s first-floor interior. Rescue workers then evacuated the unresponsive man, police said.  Detectives believe the man “started a small fire in the first-floor area of the home and then moved to the second floor, where he committed suicide with a handgun,” police spokesman Sgt. Mike Puetz said in a news release.     The medical examiner’s office will make a final ruling on the cause of death, Puetz said.
