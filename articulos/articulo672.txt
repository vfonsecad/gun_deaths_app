1 Just before 2 p.m. Saturday afternoon shots rang out at the intersection of Hill and Lincoln Avenues.  Witnesses told police a black male walked up to the silver Honda 33-year-old Tommy Young was sitting in and fired several shots. Young was hit multiple times and died at the scene. "People embraced him he helped you, if he could. You know, he was just a good person," said Tracee, a friend of Young's. Jackson Police are also investigating two separate homicides that occurred Saturday morning. Timothy Collins, 38, was shot multiple times in the parking lot of Berwood Apartments on Forest Avenue about 12:30 a.m.  Meanwhile, just before 2 a.m., 23-year-old Lamon Arrington was gunned down at the corner of Martin Luther King drive and Lanier Avenue. He was shot five times. The Hattiesburg man died at the scene.  Now, instead of sitting around a Christmas tree, three families will have to make funeral arrangements. "It's a sad situation, due to the fact Christmas is just around the corner. We have a lot of families here visiting relatives," said Jackson Police Officer Colendula Green. Sixty homicides have occurred in Jackson this year. Many say the violence is too much to bear on city streets. "I really wish people would stop using guns, killing each other, trying to solve problems. That's not gone help anything, that only creates more problems and cause more tension in the communities," added Young's friend Tracee. Copyright 2012 MSNewsNow.
