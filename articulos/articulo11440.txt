"Dear Misty, I am sorry for causing all this pain and suffering you are going through. It wasn't my intention to cause you pain. I tried hard to make you and the kids happy and give you everything. The way things are now isn't what I was expecting. I thought we would be happier now that the military was out of the picture, but I was wrong. It seems things have been worse and I know I am to blame for a lot of it. I made a lot of mistakes and I am sorry. I really am. I love you and I'll do anything for you, just tell me what it is. Love, Mike." The military has established a suicide prevention hotline for active-duty and former military personnel. 1-800-273-8255 Every morning I wake up and open my eyes, roll over and realize it wasnât a nightmare. Heâs dead. Not deployed. Not at work or in the bathroom. Heâs gone forever. â Misty Blum, in a journal entry five weeks after her husbandâs Sept. 15 suicide. WENTZVILLE â¢ Michael Blum didnât propose marriage to Misty. He commanded it. âHe said we are going to Vegas, and I am going to marry you,â Misty said. âIt was the only spontaneous thing the man had done in his life. His life was dictated by the Marine Corps.â And so with the promise of the New Year in 2003 riding with them, they jumped in the car and steered toward a drive-through chapel several hours away. Of course people wouldnât approve. But Misty said it was liberating to do what she wanted, not what others expected. She liked how easy it was to be with Michael. For the first time, she felt at home. It was exciting to fall in love, too. She had never been on an airplane until she first flew from St. Louis to visit him on the West Coast. Sheâd never even seen the ocean until he showed it to her. And they had history together. She had first met him in 1993 in OâFallon, Mo., where they both grew up. He stepped out of a primer-gray convertible Mustang, and barely said hello. He seemed like the tallest person she had ever seen. He was 18, notably quiet and about to join the Marines. She was 14, a spunky blonde freshman at Fort Zumwalt North High School. They dated for a spell, and he even at one point proposed marriage. They lost touch when he was sent to Japan. About a decade later, each with failed marriages, they reconnected online. In fact, a few weeks after Mistyâs divorce was final, Michael flew her out to California, where he was based at the time, as a celebratory gift. She knew he had a serious streak and few words to offer. When he told her he was going to marry her during the trip, he meant it. âThe whole drive to Vegas, I went from being excited, to terrified, to nearly puking,â Misty said. They pulled up to the Little White Wedding Chapel and filled out the paperwork at the 24-hour drive-through window. They stepped out of the car for a five-minute ceremony. They were officially married Jan. 4, 2003, a few minutes past midnight. Michael paid 20 bucks for one Polaroid. There was no time to linger. He had to be back to base by morning because he wasnât supposed to be far from post. Buildup to the Iraq war was mounting. A few weeks after the wedding, he flew to Kuwait and readied for battle. âThey say the first year of a marriage is the hardest,â Misty said. âWell, yes and no. We never even argued once. He spent our honeymoon in Iraq. I spent it watching CNN. I didnât hear from him for 45 days. âWhen we finally did talk, it was magical,â she said. âHe was safe.â â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢  My rational brain knows he was sick, and I tried for years to get him help. My heart says I wasn't a good enough wife to make him want to stay. I didn't try hard enough â¦ â Misty's journal entry After his first Iraq tour, Michael was handed a task that was harder on him than deploying to the desert before comfortable bases were set up. Staff Sgt. Michael Blum was to become a recruiter. He was a believer. He had pride in the uniform. He had overseas experience, most recently as an aircraft mechanic. He came from a military family. There was just one problem: He was uncomfortable speaking. On top of that, he was parachuting into brutal terrain for the task at hand â the prominent northwest suburbs of Chicago. In the car, this time moving toward the Midwest, Misty found out she was pregnant. With the added stress of new home life and what seemed like insurmountable recruitment goals, Michaelâs confident character withered to a nub. He sweated in his sleep. He became short-tempered and mean. Misty said he worried so much he had internal bleeding. âIt was a miserable existence,â she said. âIt became our normal existence.â One day she found Michael in a dark bathroom, crying. Heâd say odd things like he wished he were dead or back in Iraq. â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ Michael illustrates an enormous challenge for the military, especially the Marines. They build troops rugged for a reason. Semper Fi, Always Faithful, is the motto, but to survive and get promoted all the way to retirement, you have to breathe absolute strength. Pain, as they say in the Marines, is weakness leaving the body. If you needed feelings, the Marines would have issued them to you. Still, Marines and their families are encouraged to look for warning signs and seek help, especially now that itâs been widely reported that an estimated 18 to 22 veterans commit suicide each day. Perhaps even higher. More service members are dying at home than at war. The crisis hotline number is plastered throughout military installations and clinics. The number of calls has risen. And thereâs been a 40 percent jump in spending at the Veterans Administration for mental health treatment. But the suicide rate has mainly stayed the same while hundreds of thousands of people have returned from lengthy wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In August, President Barack Obama touted the National Research Action Plan as an effort to better collaborate between government agencies, academics and other mental health professionals to provide more effective and quicker treatment. U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the House Committee on Veteransâ Affairs, says large increases in government funding to combat the suicide âepidemicâ havenât come with good results. A recent Inspector General report found most veterans seeking VA mental health care wait on average 50 days for an evaluation. âWhen a veteran is seeking mental health care services, the difference of a day, a week or a month can make the difference between life and death,â Miller said, in a recent column in the Huffington Post. âIt takes courage for these veterans to stand up and ask for help.â Perhaps most alarming, victimâs advocates say many of these deaths could be prevented. The signs are often similar, said Greg Muffler, who got involved with the Focus Marines FoundationÂ in 2012 after his son, Adam, 24, of Webster Groves, killed himself. Adam had done stints as a Marine mechanic in Iraq and Afghanistan. When he got out of the military, he struggled to find his groove at St. Louis University. Bills piled up. He felt alone in a crowd. His marriage failed. He'd attempted suicide before. But he thrived at mixed martial arts and used it as an outlet. âOne of the things that haunts me is that I wasnât educated enough to see the warning signs,â Greg Muffler said. âIf I knew then what I know now, I sure as hell would have tried more.â Now the father mentors veterans at a Focus Marines retreat in Augusta. âAlmost every Marine I see come through there looks, sounds and behaves just like Adam did,â Greg Muffler said. âThe symptoms are so common, itâs almost frightening. Thereâs a sense of worthlessness, almost hatred for themselves. It becomes very plausible in their minds that the best solution for everybody is for them not to be here.â â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ While Misty had been told not to hesitate to contact command if there were problems, there was also an unofficial script written on the walls of the Marine Corps. If she reported her husbandâs suicidal behavior, Michael could be labeled as weak. An explosion hadnât physically maimed him. His injuries were invisible, not heroic. But in 2005, when Michael was struggling to recruit, she said she made the bold call to his commanding officer. She said the officer was understanding on the telephone, but Michael never got a mental health screening. She thinks he must have denied having issues. âNobody wants to ruin their career, and thatâs what happened,â she said. Darwyn Walker, executive director of the St. Louis chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, said thatâs a common belief. âThe military pretty much makes it known that we are interested in people who can perform,â he said. âIf not, they are discharged.â Michael was pulled out of active recruiting and assigned to clerical work with a group of Marines being disciplined for conduct issues. Misty said her husband was never promoted again for the remaining eight years of his 20-year career. But he was alive, and he eventually finished the assignment in Chicago. They moved back to California, with another child in tow. Soon Michael deployed to Iraq a second, third and fourth time. He never took more than a couple weeks off between deployments. By the time he retired last spring, he had more than two months of vacation piled up. He and Misty looked forward to moving back to Missouri. He had blamed the military for his stress. He dreamed of opening his own shop to restore old muscle cars. The first one on the list was the primer-gray convertible Mustang still parked at his parentsâ house. â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢ I tried hard to make you and the kids happy and give you everything. The way things are now isn't what I was expecting. I thought we would be happier now that the military was out of the picture, but I was wrong. â Michael Blum, in an undated note found by police. They settled in a Wentzville neighborhood called White Fence Estates. Though Michael had worked as a mechanic for years in the Marines, he lacked certification to work in the civilian world. He enrolled at Ranken Tech and became frustrated again. The VA lost his paperwork, and he struggled until the last minute to get tuition reimbursement. But he didnât like Ranken. He thought he knew how to fix cars and just needed the certification. He was twice the age of the other students, yet with no more authority. At home, Michael started gravitating to the garage. With the cars parked outside, he made a nest for himself. He stared at the walls or played a cellphone video game called Candy Crush for hours while Misty worked a new job as a clerk at a car warranty company. Michael felt entitled to drink too much. Here he was 38 and officially retired from the Marines. Misty said he stopped playing with the kids. He yelled at them. He even dared one of them to take a swing. She told him sheâd call the police if he hurt them. Their marriage was falling apart. âHe was a very depressed person, but he would not admit it,â she said. One day he told her that heâd finally tried to set up an appointment with a private shrink. Out of pride, she said, he didnât want to go to the VA. He must have said he wasnât a threat to himself or others, because they couldnât fit him in for four to six weeks. â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢  I know I did not pull the trigger, but I do feel I killed him in not saving him. If I could have stopped him, I would have. . . Doctors call it 'survivor's guilt.' I call it the worst I've ever felt in 34 years. â Misty, journal entry Sept. 15, 2013, four days after Michael called the doctor, he walked up to Misty at home and told her he wanted her and the children to have a beautiful life. She told him the same in response, brushing it off as an odd but not unusual remark. Then she heard the bolt click on a high-powered rifle in another room. Michael always kept weapons locked away from the children. She called police because she feared for the family. She ended up having a dual conversation with a 911 operator and Michael at the same time. She got him to the garage and held the door shut. He pushed back, then let go. After she heard a pop, she grabbed the kids and ran outside the house. Unsure if he was still alive, she warned police that Michael was an expert rifleman recently retired from the Marines. A SWAT team arrived. Police tried to call him. No answer. Approaching midnight, lights beamed on the house. âIt was lit up like Vegas,â Misty said. When police finally opened the garage door, they found Michael lying dead, inside his man cave with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. His death was later officially ruled a suicide. The medical examiner noted in the report that the body was that of a well-developed, 38-year-old white male. The toxicology report was clean. Nothing in his system. His body was decorated with many patriotic tattoos. He had a combination of eagles and U.S. flags on his chest, shoulders and wrist. On a pile of bones, there was a bulldog bearing a rifle near the block letters: "USMC." The only thing I know is tomorrow morning will come, I will open my eyes and again realize he's not coming home. âMisty, journal entry Â  Editorâs note: This report was based on interviews with Misty Blum and family members, as well as public documents.
