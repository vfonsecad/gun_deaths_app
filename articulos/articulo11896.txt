The vehicle was found at Edison and North Orchard avenues in Dayton.                    By  Breaking News Staff DAYTON —  A man in his 20s was found shot to death Monday evening and police have asked for the public's help. Dayton police were dispatched to Edison and North Orchard avenues just after 8 p.m. on a report of a shooting, Dayton Lt. Mark Ponichtera said. Police found the male, who had been hit by gunfire several times, in an SUV that had hit a fence and house in the 200 block of North Orchard Avenue, Ponichtera said. A second male in the vehicle was not injured, the lieutenant said, and was being interviewed by homicide detectives at the scene. A preliminary investigation revealed that police believe a confrontation began elsewhere and ended with the shooting where the SUV was found, he said. Police are looking for a red or orange vehicle believed to be a Cadillac that could have some rear-end damage, Ponichtera said. Police, combing the area for evidence, found shell casings. The SUV was seized as evidence. Ponichtera said the police department is asking anyone with information about the incident to call police at (937) 333-COPS.  © 2014 Cox Media Group.
