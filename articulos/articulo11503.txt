Before 2 p.m. Tuesday, Dane County Sheriff's Dept. deputies discovered the bodies of a man and woman inside a home on County N just north of Sun Prairie. Autopsies scheduled Wednesday morning aim to determine a cause of death and whether a crime was committed. A search of the home was prompted by an employer concerned someone did not show up for their shift. The medical examiner and other investigators were at the home Tuesday. The Sheriff's Dept. does not expect anyone else is in danger but would not speculate as to what happened until after the autopsies. Neighbors tell NBC 15 the farm is home to a woman who grew up on the property and her husband. Investigators would not say whether the couple were the victims discovered Tuesday. Neighbors say both the man and woman (whose names NBC 15 is withholding until the deceased are identified by the medical examiner) work at the same bakery in Madison. Staff at the bakery were aware of the investigation but would not confirm whether it was their employee feared missing. ______________________________________ UPDATED: Tuesday, September 17, 2013 --- 7:29 p.m. Authorities are investigating the death of an adult male and adult female in the town of Bristol.
