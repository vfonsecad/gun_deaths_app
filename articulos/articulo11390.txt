1 1 Fresno Police say two people were shot and killed in Southeast Fresno Friday night. Officers also say the shooter may be locked inside an apartment with a gun. Police say they were called to Willow Avenue and Alta Lane just after 7pm on Friday. Officers say they found a man dead at one apartment complex and then a few minutes later found a woman dead at another apartment complex. Officers tell KMPH that they believe the victims were killed by the same person and that witnesses saw the shooter run into an apartment. Since the victims were found in different places officers say they don't know how the two are connected and they don't know if the shooting is gang related.
