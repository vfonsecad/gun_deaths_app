1 1 Markice Delshawn Brider, a 29-year-old black man, was shot and killed Monday, Sept. 23, in the 2200 block of East 114th Street in Watts, according to L.A. County coronerâs records. Brider was walking eastbound on East 114th street near a gym in the Imperial Courts housing projects when four men drove up in a minivan and two people exited and began firing, said Los Angeles Police Det. Supervisor Sal LaBarbera. Brider attempted to flee but was shot multiple times while lying on the ground, LaBarbera said.  Brider was pronounced dead at the scene at 7:51 p.m., said coronerâs spokesman Ed Winter. The shooting is believed to be related to another homicide that occurred 10 minutes earlier near the Nickerson Gardens public housing projects, LaBarbera said.  In that slaying, Kevin White, 44, was gunned down in the 1600 block of East 114th Street.  Anyone with information can call the Criminal Gang Homicide Division at (213) 485-4341.
