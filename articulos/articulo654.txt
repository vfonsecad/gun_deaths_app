Posted: Sunday, December 23, 2012 1:26 pm                         POLICE BRIEF: Two Shootings Saturday Night, One Dead                A shooting Saturday night in north Long Beach left one person dead and another in the hospital, according to the Long Beach Police Department. Officers were called to the 200 block of East Pleasant Street at about 11:20 p.m. Saturday night. When they arrived, they found two victims with gunshot wounds to their upper torsos. Both were taken to the hospital, where 18-year-old Miguel Alvarez succumbed to his wounds. The other victim, whom police did not identify, is in stable condition. Investigators said the young men were standing in front of a residence when the shooting occurred. There is no suspect information at this time. Anyone who may have information regarding this crime is urged to contact Long Beach Police Homicide Detectives Hugo Cortes or Pete Lackovic at 570-7244.

Less than an hour later, officers responded to an unknown trouble call at Eighth Street and Pine Avenue. When officers arrived at 12:13 a.m., it was determined to be a domestic violence incident and the suspect had fled the scene. At about 12:45 a.m., officers saw a car and suspect near Long Beach Boulevard and Sixth Street. As officers drove up to the vehicle, two suspects exited the car and ran in opposite directions. One suspect pulled a handgun while running, and officers shot and hit him. The subject, identified as Rashid Minor, 25, Long Beach was taken to the hospital, underwent surgery and is in stable condition. A handgun was recovered at the scene, and Minor will be charged with assault with a deadly weapon against a police officer. The other suspect, later identified as the domestic violence suspect, was taken into custody near Eighth Street and Pine Avenue. Because the investigation is ongoing, he was not identified. âHarry Saltzgaver          Posted in         Crime,         News                  on                       Sunday, December 23, 2012 1:26 pm.                                 | Tags:                                                                           News,                                                                                                              Shootings,                                                                                                              Police Shooting,                                                                                                              Death,                                                                                                              Domestic Violence,                                                                                                              Long Beach Police Department,                                                                                                              Long Beach,                                                                                                              Gazette                                                   © Copyright 2014, Long Beach Grunion Gazette Newspapers: Breaking News, Sports, Business, Entertainment & Long Beach News , Long Beach, CA.
