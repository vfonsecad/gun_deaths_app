It started with a call to police at 10 p.m. Tuesday, alerting them to a gruesome scene at a Greenacres home. Not long after midnight Wednesday, gunshots rang out in Riviera Beach, leaving one man dead and another gravely injured. Hours later, on Thursday morning, another shooting — this time in West Palm Beach — left a man dead in the road. The killings bring the murder toll to 44 in Palm Beach County so far this year, according to law enforcement records. Last year, 57 people were killed in the county through August. Late Thursday, Riviera Beach police announced the arrest of three people, including a 17-year-old male who has been accused of first-degree murder. His name was not released because he had not been charged as an adult as of late Thursday. Moslaint Joseph and Fenel Joseph, both 18, were arrested on charges of being an accessory after the fact. They and the teen are expected to face additional charges. The victim in Thursday’s shooting was identified as Jeremy Taylor, 19. The injured man was identified as Emmanuel Augustin, 19. Augustin remained in critical condition late Thursday, police said. Augustin was in a vehicle with the Josephs and the 17-year-old and was wounded during an exchange of gunfire, Riviera Beach Police spokeswoman Rose Anne Brown said. His alleged accomplices took him to St. Mary’s Medical Center. It is believed that Taylor shot Augustin, Brown said A 9 mm firearm was found near his body. When Augustin arrived at St. Mary’s, sheriff’s deputies detained the other three men as the car they were in had been reported stolen. They were questioned by Riviera Beach police and subsequently arrested. Thursday’s shooting death in Riviera Beach was the fourth murder this year in the city comparied with seven murders through August 2012. In West Palm Beach, nine people have been slain this year compared with 13 through August 2012. In the Greenacres case from Tuesday, Scott Kenneth Tobiassen, 49, is charged with bludgeoning his roommate, Gerard Thomas Longo, 48, and dismembering his body. West Palm Beach police continue to investigate Thursday morning’s shooting that left one man dead in the road in the 500 block of 38th Street just west of Spruce Avenue. Callers alerted police to gunfire about 5:54 a.m. Don Lent, who has lived on the street for three years, said the man didn’t appear to be one of his neighbors and said he was surprised that a shooting happened on an otherwise quiet street. “We kind of look out for each other,” Lent said, sipping coffee as investigators worked the scene. Police say they are still working to identify the victim. “We have no witnesses, no vehicles. No one really heard or saw anything,” said West Palm Beach Police Lt. Dennis Wrobbel. The three murders are part of what has been a violent few days in the county. Tuesday, two shootings were reported within an hour of each other in Riviera Beach. Police responded to the first report of shots fired in the 600 block of West Second Street at 3:30 p.m. They found two vehicles riddled with bullet holes, and shortly after three men with gunshot wounds arrived at St. Mary’s Medical Center. Their injuries weren’t life-threatening. At 4:15 p.m., witnesses reported people in two vehicles shooting at each other in the 900 block of West Seventh Street. The vehicles were gone by the time police arrived. No victims were identified. Staff writer Julius Whigham II contributed to this report. comment(37) © 2014 Cox Media Group.
