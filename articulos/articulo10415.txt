The deceased, Robert Love III, 25, was at his home at 7815 Bellewood Drive when he was shot by his uncle whose name was not released by police. According to the police report, officers were dispatched to the scene for a shooting in progress. When they arrived, the uncle, 59, was on the driveway and said he had shot his nephew after the nephew assaulted him and pointed a gun in his direction. Officers noted multiple injuries to the uncle and found Love inside dead from a fatal gunshot wound. The shooter was released without being charged and the case is being referred to the Harris County Grand Jury for review.
