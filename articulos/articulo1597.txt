1 1   PITTSBURG -- Authorities identified a 20-year-old Pittsburg man who died Tuesday after he was shot in the head in what police say was a targeted killing. Timothy Smith Jr. was at the Unocal gas station at 2150 Railroad Ave. just after 9 a.m. when he was shot; he died several hours later. Authorities have named Brian Fox, 22, as a "person of interest" in the case. Information from witnesses led authorities to a home in Bay Point about an hour after the shooting, where SWAT officers surrounded a small house on Marin Avenue. After four hours, police declared the house clear and said Fox had not been found. Police have not said why they believe Smith was targeted in the killing. It was Pittsburg's second homicide of the year. Contact Daniel M. Jimenez at djimenez@bayareanewsgroup.com. Follow him at Twitter.com/DMJreports.
