The largest Briarcliff mansion on the hill west of U.S. 169 north of downtown Kansas City, which impressed locals as well as visitors, was a showpiece of the upscale residential and business development. Fire officials said they had found no reason to consider a suspicious cause. Iowa State has its best win of the season, 94-83 over Kansas in a Big 12 semifinal, and the Jayhawks have a reminder to the college basketball world: they are mediocre defensively, and the team that knocks them out of the NCAA Tournament will likely take advantage of this. Big 12 commissioner Bob Bowlsby reiterated his position from earlier this week, when he told The Star that the men’s basketball tournament would go up for bid after 2016. “But,” Bowlsby said, “I want to be as direct as I can be and that’s simply to say that Kansas City does an extraordinary job of hosting this. … “It’s going to take a Herculean effort for somebody to take this away from Kansas City.” One Light, the first new residential tower built downtown since the 32-story San Francisco building opened in Crown Center in 1976, was first announced 11/2 years ago, but Cordish officials said design tweaks to the 315-unit building delayed its construction start. If the 25-story apartment project at 13th and Walnut is a success, Cordish plans to build three more high-rises. Denver-based Roth is taking a 5,750-square-foot space in the Skelly Building at 601 W. 47th St., next to the House of Hoops store. After major remodeling, Roth plans to open a showroom this fall. There was a wistfulness in the old mans eyes as he strolled beside his bride of 45 years before the Big 12 basketball tournament downtown. They had been here before, he said. Another lifetime ago.

She later was removed from a ventilator. Police were called to the girls home in the 10500 block of Monroe Avenue just before noon Jan. 10. Officers found Trinity lying on her back on the living room floor near the television with a gunshot wound to her forehead. Two relatives, boys ages 5 and 6, were standing in the corner of the living room. A 58-year-old woman who lives at the home said Trinity is her husbands daughter. The girl had just gotten out of the Freda Markley Early Childhood Center at 11:30 a.m. The woman was watching the three kids. She left them in the living room while she went outside to get something from her car, police said. She heard a gunshot, ran back inside and found Trinity wounded. The woman put the gun on the TV and called police. She pressed a cloth to Trinitys forehead to try to stop the bleeding while waiting for an ambulance. Police determined that the older boy apparently found the five-shot revolver under a jacket on a chair and fired it. The woman told police she didnt know the gun was there. She said the gun belonged to a relative of the boys.  The staff at Freda Markley took Trinitys death very hard, a school official said. Staff members had just celebrated her birthday and knew at least one of the boys from the early childhood program. Police were assembling the necessary reports to give to prosecutors, who will decide whether to file criminal charges against any adults.
