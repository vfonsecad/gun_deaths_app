1 1  A single mother of five from Hardee County was found shot to death in an east Manatee County orange grove Wednesday afternoon, deputies said.  Maria Moralez, 42, of Bowling Green, worked at the grove at 42800 State Road 62 E. in Duette, Manatee Sheriff Brad Steube said in a news release.   Detectives said they want to talk to Moralez’s former boyfriend, Joel Ramirez-Hernandez, 33,  who did not show up at his job Thursday as a farmworker in Hardee County.   Moralez’s body was discovered in a tractor by a co-worker concerned after she did not return to the company barn at her usual time, Steube said. She had been seen alive earlier in the day. The co-worker called 911, and Manatee sheriff’s deputies responded about 5:50 p.m.   Anyone with information was asked to call the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office at (941) 747-3011, ext. 2159, or Crime Stopppers at 1-866-634-TIPS (8477).
