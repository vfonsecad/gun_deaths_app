Around 10 p.m. Monday, deputies say 21-year-old Lapier Mitchell was shot and killed in the 4500 block of Harvest Valley — which is off Bolen Huse Road north of Raleigh. So far, deputies haven’t released any information about any suspects. The other shooting happened just before 1 a.m. Tuesday in the 1300 block of Kimball Cove in the Cherokee neighborhood. Police say a 24-year-old man was shot and taken to the MED in critical condition. Police have identified one suspect in this case — but haven’t released a description.
