The woman, identified by family members as Cheronda Griffith, told police she and her husband Earnest Griffith Jr., were parked at the Sunnyvale Station convenience store in East Oak Cliff when they were approached by two men. The men walked over to the Griffith's pickup truck, pointed a gun, demanded money and then told the couple to get out of the truck, according to the woman. As the couple exited the truck, they were both shot. Soon after, police were called and responded to the location at the corner of Sunnyvale Street and Marfa Avenue at about 7:30 p.m.  Police found the couple’s Ford pickup had rolled over a curb and come to rest in bushes down the street from the gas station. According to the police report, Earnest suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was taken to Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas where he died from his injuries.   Cheronda was shot in the upper body and is recovering.  She is expected to be released from the hospital sometime Friday, family members told NBC 5. Family members said Griffith died just hours from his 41st birthday on Friday and that a large family gathering had already been planned for Friday night. The investigation into the shooting is ongoing and police said they plan to review video from the gas station for any clues about the identity of the gunman.
