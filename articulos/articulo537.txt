1 My colleague Robert Gavin reports: A parolee who survived a 2006 shooting in Albany was shot to death Tuesday morning in WestÂ Hill. Iquan Carter, 23, who was just released from Elmira Correctional Facility on Sept. 17, was shot on Ontario Street, between Second and Third streets, following an argument with his killer, according toÂ police.Â He drew an unloaded gun on his armed killer, according to people with knowledge of theÂ investigation. Carter stumbled through an alley before collapsing in the back yard of 55 Ontario St., authoritiesÂ said.Â Carter was treated by paramedics and rushed toÂ Albany Medical Center Hospital, where he was pronouncedÂ dead. Police were canvassing the neighborhood. No arrests wereÂ reported. Read the full story here. It’s good to know that there are some people walking around with UNLOADED guns on them, I feel a little safer. Don’t get too comfortable G Â®.  Those assault rifles are flying off shelves. I sure love the heading of this story. TimesUnion always seems to shed negativity on a situation that is already negative. Way to Go TU! Reagardless to what this man did in the past, he is dead now. This is someones Son, father….etc! Geesh! It’s never a good idea to pull a gun unless you intend to kill the person you are aiming at -particularly if that person has a gun. Snicker, I bet they are…but this isn’t New Orleans or Houston, most people with AR-15′s don’t have them in the front seat of their Ford Explorer. Um, let’s see…. just released from prison in September – check!  Arguing with someone who may have a gun – check!  Pulling an UN-loaded gun on someone – check!  Being shot by the other person – check!   Keep in mind this fellow should not have been able to have possession of a firearm under New York State gun laws, but he had one anyway.  I imagine it was illegally obtained. Sorry, I’ve got no sypathy for this guy.  He apparently didn’t learn his lessons the first go-round in prison. What exactly is it that @3 is complaining about?  The man was on parole and that means it was illegal for him to have a handgun, loaded or otherwise.  How do you know he’s someone’s father?  If he was, then perhaps he should have been thinking about his kid(s) instead of hanging around with a gun. Misdemeanor Murder…. Bye Bye.  Someone gave him the same as he had been dishing out.  One less for the Parole Officer to check on. It truly is a shame, but obviously he wasn’t attempting to turn his life around.  “Those who live by the sword…” WHAT’S WORSE THAN BRINGING A KNIFE TO A GUNFIGHT? BRINGING A GUN TO A GUNFIGHT WITHOUT ANY BULLETS DOH!!! i wonder if these 2 citizens had the required pistol permits? or back ground checks to obtain them I’m amused that Cater wasn’t described as a “victim”, he just didn’t have time to acquire ammo.  The parole board should be held responsible for exposing citizens to the likes of Carter.  Maybe, justice was served after all. jeff, even if they did (they didn’t), it still would have been illegal to have them on the streets like that. John, we’re exposed to much worse than Carter, we just don’t know it until they burst into an elementary school. All the potential new changes to existing gun laws will surely prevent all these types of occurrences from ever happening again. *coughstifleslaughcough* First I want to say RIP ‘IKE’….Second he was a father, A brother,Newphew,A good friend.To all the ppl posting negative comments would of that was your son .ppl at times make mistakes.yes he had a unloaded gun meaning he did not have plans on killing any one duuhh.to the person that don’t have sypathy you one cold hearted person .R.i.P Ike no bullets probably didnt have time to buy them ”Nephew’ Sister of carter: First I’m sorry for the loss your family suffered at this time of year, but sister take your blinders off honey. He had NO business carrying a gun, loaded or not, and if he was caught he would have ended up back in prison. Indeed, according to NUS DOCS, the charge he was previously incarerated under was CRIM POSS WEAP 3RD SUB 4-8 VFO. So, Carter knew he had no business carrying a gun, and doing so violated the conditions of his parole. If your brother was carrying an unloaded weapon it was because he had plans to intimidate or possibly steal people. So, please, don’t make it sound like he was carrying around a toy gun and was planning on going treat or treating. I’m fully sympathetic with the fact that ex-cons have a hard time finding work in good economic climates, let alone the current one. The first Christmas after being released is particulry stressful and teh ex-con often feels they have to get a lot of presents for the family as a way of paying them back for supporting them in jail. I can only imagine your brother may have been thinking about getting a nice quick score, because he absolutely had no business carrying a gun, loaded or unloaded. The only saving grace here is that no innocent civilians were injured and hopefully the thug who murdered your brother will soon be off the street and no longer able to terrorize anyone else. But please, don’t suggest that an ex-con with a history of carrying guns was carrying an unloaded weapon for no reason at all. Ex-cons who carry weapons do so because they intend to use it or sell it. #13 G There are many, many Carters, getting “Rehabed” and many more in America’s cities. And where were his sisters,brothers, uncles, kids etc when he was in and  out  of  prison? No one stopped to smack him in  his  head  and tell him to  stop  being  idiot? None of his family cared about  their community enough to stop him from his nonsense? What happen to protecting womanhood  and  promoting  manhgood? No one in ur family  down with that????  Pathetic. This is the perfect example of why stricter gun laws, bans, or restrictions will not work! How is it that a parolee can acquire a firearm within 3 months from being released from prison but it takes an Albany resident up to a year and a few hundred dollars just to get their concealed carry permit? Luckily most places that sell ammunition will not sell it without a permit, places like Dicks, Wal-Mart, and most gun stores. Maybe that is what prevented this convict from causing more people to die, but we already have these restrictions in place. So what is the solution to the gun problem? Finding out the why, working on correcting social problems, and getting people the help they need. Not focusing on the tools used to commit crimes, but surprise surprise, focusing on the people who commit them. It is just like America to try and find the easy fix by passing knee-jerk laws but it will not do anything to help bring an end to the gun violence. Stop the presses!!! Jango got this one right. criminals will always get guns , but outside of a criminal background check maybe a mental health background check should be included that might help out alot but then you would have to do away with the HIPA law This is sad, no matter how you slice it. Sometimes decent people make poor choices, sometimes people make poor choices because no one gives them a break.  I pray for the best for this gentleman’s family, I don’t care that he was on parole, he was a person.  We have to change society so that the we ridicule and mock the ones who carry guns, both legal and illegal.  People who have the need to have such weapons have issues of adequacy and low self esteem. Bob Costas was right when he quoted Jason Whitlock’s column (Whitlock was right too), and this is the discussion we need to have.  Not later, but now, we need to get a handle on guns, period. He was definitely not doing community service w that gun. And Should have thought of his child. Another child w no father. Prison 1 st,now dead. #23 There is a tracking database run by the federal government and some states are on it. NY is currently in the process of doing this and will likely be live next year. It does depend on the hospitals and facilities to participate and report people with certain conditions who are involuntarily admitted to the psych facility. It does not do away with HIPAA; the information is coded/scrambled so that the state doesn’t see the name or soc, only the date, and is purged regularly. Sister of Carter, I am sorry for your loss and understand this must be difficult to handle. We can’t make people change and there are a lot of good people who do bad things. I hope his murderer is punished. It doesn’t matter what he did years ago it doesn’t matter but it does matter that his life was taking away from him so yah with yah negative comments I’m quite sure you’re family did the same but you just a shame to admit it cause Jango and Black and Tina it doesn’t matter where you live at and I bet these people that is saying negative things take a look out you’re window and see take a look in you’re mirror so who to say for you to judge somebody a life was taking from his family and friends I don’t care what anybody does the problem is GET THE GUNS OFF THE STREETS THAT IS ALL PEOPLE DO IS TALK NEGATIVE ABOUT ONE ANOTHER THAT IS WHY PEOPLE HAVE BAD JUDGEMENT DAYS BAD LIFE HISTORY BAD EVERYTHING SO FOR YAH TO JUDGE PEOPLE JUDGE YOU’RE SELF CAUSE NONE OF YAH ON HERE THAT IS MAKING NEGATIVE COMMENTS IS BETTER CAUSE I BET YAH DID A CRIME SO COME OUT THE CLOSET @ theresa i so agree with you…. This is someones family member and the people whom are all talking negative have all lost someone in there life and Im for sure the lost hurted him…. It makes me mad cause Yes maybe he messed up by having a gun but how long now have this foolishness been going on…. People wake up, the guns are still on the streets for a reason….  Someone Big time is giving them out… Lets Stay focus on the fact that this man is a victim just like anybody else that dies to gun violence…. Yes he Did have a gun but that dont mean he deserves to die… No one do… Back in prison Yes but to die no…  And the medÃ­a them selves are selfless bringing this man past info to the streets…. He’s dead why not let his family grieve…. What hora around comes around and everyone that made a bad statement about this man while his family grieve will all feel there pain one day… God bless the carter family and Stay strong cause them that judge the life of others need to look in the mirror and judge themselves Maybe he was bringing it to a gun by back?       Not in a million years. Jango and I couldn’t be less alike in our views and yet here we agree. I am sorry that a man is dead and that a family in my city grieves and yet this man knew that his parole meant NO GUNS.  Maybe he’d have been dead anyhow but I can’t help but wonder if his walking on Ontario St with a gun lead to his own death. I am a gun owner and the first rule is the assumtion that all guns are loaded. The murderer in this case probale assumed the same when he pulled the trigger. If someone were to break into my home at 3am with a gun, I’m not going to stop to ask if the gun is loaded. When seconds count, the police areonly minutes away! Ms Harris, I don’t like reading that someone was shot dead on the street, but when I look in the mirror I see someone who has never committed a crime, who volunteers to help the community, and who is raising a child to follow that lead.
