1  The wife of a Texas pastor reportedly took her own life this weekend in the parking lot of McClelland Gun Shop, located in East Dallas, Texas, presumably using the pistol she had just purchased from the firearms supplier, according to reports. Harriet Deison, 65, wife of Pastor Pete Deison of Park Cities Presbyterian Church, was found dead in her Lexus Sedan after employees of McClelland Gun Shop heard gunfire around 2:15 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 29. It appeared as though Deison shot herself. Authorities are reporting that Deison took her own life, although no suicide note was left at the scene of the shooting. In an op-ed piece in The Chattanoogan, columnist Roy Exum, a friend of the Deison family, said the pastor's wife "charmed all of our hearts" and "exemplified her life into a role model that hundreds of women have followed." "I believe she could do anything from arranging flowers to running a big company in Dallas, both of which she did adroitly," Exum added. In addition to serving the church congregation as the pastor's wife, Deison also ran the Minwood One Corp., described by MerchantBook as a "collection agencies industry."
