1 1 Staff reports Ricordo Levon Williams, 31, has surrendered himself to the Aiken County Sheriffâs Office. Williams was wanted in connection to a shooting that occurred in Wagener on Thursday night. The victim of the shooting has been identified as Kerry Eck, 25, of Lexington, according to Aiken County Coroner Tim Carlton. Around 9:48 p.m. on Thursday, deputies responded to Jeffcoat Road after a witness called 911 about the shooting, according to the report. The witness told deputies that she and the Eck were at that location meeting with Williams, according to the report. Williams and Eck were allegedly involved in a physical altercation when Williams allegedly shot Eck in the head with an unknown type of weapon. The witness fled the area until she was able to alert authorities about the incident, according to the report. Eck was found dead in an abandon vehicle near the intersection of S.C. Highway 39 and Camp Rawls Road, officials said. An autopsy was completed on Friday, and her death is being ruled as a homicide. The cause of death is severe head trauma from a gun shot wound. Eck was pronounced dead at approximately 3:30 a.m. on Friday. She leaves behind three young children. Officials believe that the possible motive in this case stems from the sale and possession of illegal narcotics. Williams turned himself into authorities around 12:45 p.m. without any incident. He will be taken to the Aiken County detention center where he will be booked for murder and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime. The shooting is being investigated by the Aiken County Sheriffâs Office and the Aiken County Coronerâs Office.
