1 1 The two Morton teenagers charged in a fatal shooting Friday night were denied bond in their initial court appearances Monday. Devon Clark, 18, and Devarius Ragsdale, 18, are charged with murder in the slaying of 38-year-old Marvin Thomas. Morton Police Chief Nicky Crapps said officers responded to a home on North Ratliff Drive shortly after 6 p.m. Friday. Officers found Thomas on the floor of the home with a gunshot wound to the leg. He was transported to Scott Regional Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Crapps said the suspects went to the home Friday and got into an argument with Thomas. The argument reportedly went from inside the residence to outside where Clark was sitting inside a vehicle. Police say Ragsdale and Thomas approached the vehicle and Clark fired twice. Thomas was struck once in the leg. Crapps said Thomas was able to run back into the house to letÂ the people inside the home know he had been shot. Ragsdale turned himself in to officers Saturday morning. Clark was arrested a short time later at a relative's house. Copyright 2013 MSNewsNow.
