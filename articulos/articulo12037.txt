1 1   			 90° F A 28-year-old man died on Saturday after he was found outside of a Daytona Beach-area bottle-club suffering from gunshot wounds. The victim, Terrell A. Lesane of Daytona Beach, died at 6:52 p.m. at Halifax Health Medical Center in Daytona Beach. He was found in the street after 5 a.m. Saturday near Papi's Bottle Club on North Nova Road after a brawl in the club spilled into the parking lot and ended with gunfire. No one has been arrested. But authorities launched a search for a thin man with dreadlocks caught on security video outside of Papi's Bottle Club to find out "what information he can provide about the shooting,'' Gary Davidson, a spokesman for the Volusia County Sheriff's Office, said in an email. The man, considered a "person of interest,'' hangs out in the St. Augustine area, Davidson said. Officials say a fight broke out in the bottle club just before closing time. The brawl spilled out into the parking lot, making a commotion that caught the attention of two nearby deputies. "As the deputies drove to the scene, they heard a gunshot ring out and then saw the crowd scatter,'' Davidson said. "Moments later, more gunfire was heard to the north of the scene." Deputies who responded to that gunfire found blood at Nova Road and 8th Street — about half a block away from Papi's. "So far, no additional victims have been located,'' Davidson said. Anyone with information is asked to contact investigator Jerry Betz with the Sheriff's Office's major case unit or Crime Stoppers of Northeast Florida at 888-277-8477.
