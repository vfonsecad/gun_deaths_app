Hughlett, 22, was pronounced dead by Columbus fire paramedics shortly after the shooting at 4:15 p.m. He was sitting in the driver’s seat of a car parked at a Wendy’s restaurant when he was shot. A second man, David Hawkins, 26, was in the passenger seat and also shot. Hawkins, who lives on the South Side according to court records, was taken to Grant Medical Center in critical condition. The hospital wouldn’t release his condition tonight, but Sgt. Christ Holzhauser said he’s expected to survive. Holzhauser didn’t have an address for Hughlett. The shooting occurred in the parking lot of the Wendy’s at 4049 E. Livingston Ave. The gunman is believed to have fired shots through the driver’s-side window, Holzhauser said. Homicide detective Paul Callahan, who is leading the investigation, said it’s too early to discuss a motive. He said detectives have not interviewed Hawkins. Hughlett had been sentenced in 2010 to four years in prison on an aggravated-robbery conviction and was released in June. amanning@dispatch.com jwoods@dispatch.com Most Popular Most Shared Dispatch Media Group
