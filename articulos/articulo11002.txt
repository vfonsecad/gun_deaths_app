1 1          A 21-year-old man killed by a north Charlotte convenience store employee Thursday night is the second alleged robber shot to death at the store in the past six years. Javon Sanchez Booker of Charlotte died after being shot about 9 p.m. at the Fast Mart store on Tom Hunter Road near Reagan Drive, Charlotte-Mecklenburg police said. That is a short distance from Interstate 85. Booker entered the store and tried to rob the clerk, according to police. Police have not said whether the suspect struck the clerk. Investigators say the clerk pulled a gun and fired at the man. The robbery suspect ran from the store but got only about a block south on Tom Hunter Road before collapsing in the street. Homicide detectives spent several hours late Thursday and early Friday checking to see if residents in the area had seen anything. Mecklenburg County jail records show Booker was arrested once, in February 2011, on a felony drug possession charge. A fatal shooting also took place at the Fast Mart on July 23, 2007. In that case, police said a man entered the store about 10:30 a.m. and was shot to death by the owner. The owner was not charged. Police ask that anyone with information about Thursdayâs fatal shooting call detectives at 704-432-TIPS. Information also can be left with Crime Stoppers, 704-334-1600, or  http://charlottecrimestoppers.com.     Subscribe to The Charlotte  Observer. This affects comments on all stories.
