Roslyn Jacobson, 80, died at 6:30 a.m. Sunday at Memorial University Medical Center, about 36 hours after Beaufort County Sheriffs  Office deputies found her wounded during a health and welfare check at her home, her son Gary Jacobson said.  Roslyn Jacobsons husband, Robert, 85, was found dead at the scene of a self-inflicted gunshot wound during Friday afternoons welfare check, a Beaufort County Sheriffs Office spokesman said Saturday. A revolver was found near his body. An investigation into the shooting continues. The Jacobsons had lived in Sun City since 1999, after retiring to Hilton Head Island from Ohio in 1986, Gary Jacobson said. Roslyn Jacobson had battled lung cancer for more than four years before her death, and neighbors said Saturday a hospice care worker visited the house the week before Fridays shooting. Robert Jacobson was a former president of the Hemlock Society of South Carolina and a supporter of the "death with dignity" movement.  A memorial service for the Jacobsons will be held at 1 p.m. Tuesday at Sauls Funeral Home in Bluffton.
