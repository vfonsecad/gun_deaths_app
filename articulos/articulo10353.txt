(WKYT) -  A man was shot and killed by an officer of the Middlesboro Police Department during a robbery at a gas station late Wednesday night, according to police. Leamond Ward, 20, of Middlesboro, was pronounced dead at the Middlesboro Appalachian Regional Hospital as a result of two gunshot wounds sustained during the incident. Officials say that they were called to the scene of a robbery at Lee's BP on 38th St. around 9:45 on Wednesday night. They were told by the 911 caller that employees and customers were attempting to restrain the man, identified as Ward.  "You always want to be very careful as a civilian when you decide to intervene. Usually the best thing to do is be a good witness," said Chief Jeffrey Sharpe, with the Middlesboro Police Department. According to police, the first officer to arrive on the scene instructed the civilians to get to safety, at which point Ward produced a knife and advanced on the officer. Police say Ward was told to drop the knife but refused and continued to move toward the officer, making slashing motions with the knife.  Authorities said at that point, the officer fired two rounds from his service weapon, striking Ward twice. The officer involved has been placed on administrative leave, pending conclusion of the investigation. How many more years do you think John Calipari will coach at Kentucky?
