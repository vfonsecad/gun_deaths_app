1 1 The police officers who shot and killed a man and wounded two other people Friday were identified Monday. Las Vegas police officers Joseph Parra, 34, and Scott Thomas, 50, shot and killed Roberto Antonio Torres, 33, about 3:30 p.m. Friday near Clark High School. Police said Torres was wanted in the attempted murder of his girlfriend. Torres had shot her in the face with a handgun at close range earlier that week, police said. Her condition was not known Monday. On Friday, officers saw Torres leave an apartment in the 4000 block of Pennwood Avenue and meet with a man and woman at a vehicle parked on the street. When the officers approached, Torres pulled a handgun and fired at them, police said. Parra and Thomas returned fire, killing Torres and wounding the man and woman. The man was in critical condition as of Friday; the woman was “superficially” wounded and was being questioned by police. Neither was charged with a crime. Parra is a patrol officer assigned to Bolden Area Command. Thomas was assigned to the career criminal section in the robbery/homicide bureau.  Both were placed on routine paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal review of the shooting. Contact reporter Mike Blasky at mblasky@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0283.
