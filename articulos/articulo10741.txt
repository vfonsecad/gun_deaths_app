Al Pickett, 52, met officers with a gun when they arrived at the apartment in the 500 block of Staunton Commons Drive on Tuesday night. The officers, who have been identified by the city as Matt Mosier and Zach Mumford, ordered Pickett to drop his gun. They then fired their weapons. According to the city, the two veteran officers have been placed on paid administrative leave.  Troy Police Chief Charles Phelps said it is unclear whether Pickett fired any shots. Mosier and Mumford were not injured.  The woman suffered multiple stab wounds to her back and suffered a leg injury. She was taken to Upper Valley Medical Center, then by CareFlight to Miami Valley Hospital. She was treated and released. In a chilling call to 911, the victim was heard by dispatchers asking the suspect not to hurt her. Witnesses said they could hear the woman screaming. Police said she has a protection order against Pickett. One witness reported hearing at least five gunshots. She said one slug entered her apartment through a window, but no one was struck. Preliminary autopsy results are expected to be complete by the end of the day on Wednesday.  The Bureau of Criminal Investigation, asked by Phelps to serve as an independent agency to handle the investigation, spent about 10 hours collecting evidence at the scene.
