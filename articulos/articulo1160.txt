The Camden County Prosecutor's Office said Rahkeem Byrd was found critically wounded in a house in the 1100 block of Thurman Street late Saturday. He was taken to Cooper University Hospital, where he died. Prosecutors said Byrd apparently was shot before 10 p.m. near Louis and Thurman Streets and fled, collapsing in the Thurman Street house.

In a second Camden County incident, a man was shot while sitting in his car in Pennsauken about 2:45 a.m. Sunday in the 4400 block of Beacon Street, police said. The victim, whose name was not immediately released was taken to Cooper University Hospital.   Contact Mark Fazlollah at 215-854-5831 or mfazlollah@phillynews.com.
