1 1 (WMC-TV) - Memphis police confirm three people were shot at the Lamar Quick Stop. One person died, and two others are in non-critical condition.    People living in the 2500 block of Lamar Avenue, where this shooting happened, say they had enough. They say the killings have to stop. One man who was at the store when it happened says it sounded like a battlefield. "It don't make sense ... Killing each other don't make sense ," said Randy Norris.  Norris said he ducked to his knees when shots rang out during a drive-by shooting at Barron Avenue and Hugenot Street Wednesday afternoon. "It sounded off, like a war, everybody just took off running," he said.  Norris said a car filled with unidentified men drove by and opened fire hitting three people in the parking lot behind the Lamar Quick Stop. According to Norris, they used AK-47s, high powered rifles, and more during the shooting. Memphis Police said a 51-year-old man died on the scene. Two others, ages 60 and 21, were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Latonya Black was told one of the victims was her nephew. "I'm very relieved, with all the gang stuff, I'm very relieved," she said.  On a day of celebration in honor of the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, Norris reflected on the state of affairs in his neighborhood. "To older people when I was coming up it means a whole lot, but these days young kids they just don't know ... half of them don't even go to school," he said.  "It's hard. I hate seeing this." Police say they have limited suspect information at this time. They are looking for a new model maroon Toyota that was possibly carrying three men at the time of the shooting. Copyright 2013 WMC-TV.
