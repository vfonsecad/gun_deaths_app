1 1 A 20-year-old man was arrested Thursday afternoon in Holiday in the shooting death of his stepfather, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said. Jason Louis Chevere fatally shot his stepfather, 49-year-old Dale Wildermuth, at their home, at 5545 Mosaic Drive, during an argument, an investigator's affidavit said. During the dispute, Wildermuth was "pushing and grabbing" his stepson and "telling him to get out of the house," the affidavit said. Afterward, Chevere went into his bedroom and retrieved a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun that was hidden in his mattress, the affidavit said. Chevere loaded the gun and prepared it for firing, the affidavit said. The arguing resumed, the affidavit said, and Chevere fired one shot into his stepfather's chest. Wildermuth died at the home about 5 p.m., the sheriff's office said. Chevere ran from the home after the shooting, but returned when deputies were there. The gun was recovered by investigators and Chevere was taken into custody, deputies said. Chevere was transported to the Land O' Lakes Detention Center. He faces a charge of first-degree murder, the report said. The sheriff's office visited the home one time this year because of a domestic dispute between Wildermuth and his wife, the suspect's mother, the sheriff's office said.
