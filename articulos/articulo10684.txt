1 1 SPRINGFIELD, Mo. --  A man is shot to death in southwest Springfield and police are looking for the gunman.  It happened near an apartment complex near Campbell Avenue at Woodland Street around 1:30 Sunday afternoon.  "We heard a couple of pops.  One of my neighbors was backing out, but it sounded more distant," said Tiffany Frasher, who was holding a charity sale in her front yard at the time. Those sounds are also what her neighbor across the street heard."I thought, 'Those are shots,' and they were loud, too, which was a ways across the street," said resident Judy Stinecipher. Stinecipher says, when she got her phone, she knew right away what those sounds were."I had my scanner on and they immediately called and said there's been a shooting at Woodland and Campbell," she said.Police say the man, now identified as 36-year-old Gregory A. Dahmm of Springfield, was at a party not far from the crime scene.  He was shot in the chest in a nearby alley and died on his way to the hospital.Detectives and search dogs canvassed the surrounding area, looking for the gunman. "What if they would have come down my road?  I don't have a gun.  I don't know what I  would have done," said Frasher. The shooting is a reality check for many people here. "Of course, you presume your neighborhood is safe, and then this.  There's been a few incidents around here and I think well, you know?," said Stinecipher. It's also made some people want to double-check their own security. "I will definitely lock my inside garage door and my back door.  I will make sure the deadbolt is locked," said Frasher. Police do not have a description of the gunman.
