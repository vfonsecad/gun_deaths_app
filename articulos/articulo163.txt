CANARSIE — A 22-year-old man was shot and killed on Farragut Road early Tuesday, according to the NYPD. Yusef Crockett was found with a gunshot wound to his torso near East 86th Street about 1:30 a.m., just down the block from his home, police said. "I heard the gunshots...two gunshots, that's it," said resident Tamla Hamilton. Paramedics rushed Crockett to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, where he died, cops said. "This is a sad story," said Paul, a resident who asked that his last name not be used. "This doesn't happen around here. In the time I've been living here nobody's been killed." Police believe Crockett may have been shot inside a nearby building and ran outside, but the investigation is ongoing. No one had been arrested as of Tuesday evening. Hamilton said the killing is indicative of how the neighborhood has changed. "I'm ready to move out of Canarsie because Canarsie is not the same as it used to be," Hamilton added. "And it's not only Canarsie, as you know. This is everywhere. I'm just ready to get out of the country, period."
