1 A suspect in a San Antonio slaying shot and killed himself while being chased by police officers just east of the Strip on Wednesday morning. Narada Goodrum, 33, was wanted on murder charges in the shooting death of his pregnant wife, Cynthia Goodrum, on Dec. 27. A task force including Las Vegas police officers and U.S. marshals were trying to arrest Goodrum when he killed himself about 10:30 a.m., according to police. Sgt. John Sheahan said the death happened at the Super 8 Hotel at 4250 Koval Lane, just south of Ellis Island Casino. According to the San Antonio Express, the couple had been arguing in the yard of their Bexar County home when Goodrum dragged his wife by her hair into the house. Officers responding to alarms at the home found the 34-year-old woman dead in her kitchen from a gunshot wound. Cynthia Goodrum filed for divorce and obtained a temporary restraining order against her husband the day before she was killed. The Express reported that the couple, who had divorced once before in 2009, had married for a second time on Dec. 18. But when Cynthia Goodrum discovered her husband had been cheating, the relationship turned sour. Police had been tracking Goodrum since last week. According to preliminary information, no officers fired their weapons. U.S. marshals were investigating. Contact reporter Mike Blasky at mblasky@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0283.
