1 Movietown Movie Club Sheila Scott Blaine Kendall  PANAMA CITY BEACH — A homicide charge against a man who shot and killed his roommate late Wednesday is unlikely, according to an official with the Bay County Sheriff’s Office, though the shooter has been arrested and booked into the jail for misleading investigators.  Blaine Kendall, 28, called authorities to his Cypress Street home just before midnight Wednesday to report that he’d shot and killed his friend, 24-year-old Thomas Crawford, when he tripped over a shotgun entering his residence. Physical evidence conflicted with Kendall’s explanation, and he later admitted he had been holding the weapon when it discharged once and struck Crawford in the head.  Maj. Tommy Ford said the investigation into the shooting is ongoing, but he said homicide charges against Kendall are unlikely at this time.  “We don’t have anything to indicate it’s anything other than an accident,” Ford said. “We’re continuing to evaluate the evidence and working with the Medical Examiner’s Office and the State Attorney’s Office to determine if additional charges are warranted.”  Officials said Kendall was distraught when deputies arrived at the scene.  The two men were roommates, Ford said, and had been friends since high school. While there were no witnesses aside from Kendall, investigators have no evidence of a physical struggle or bad blood between the two men. Kendall might have been drinking but there’s no evidence he was impaired, Ford said.  “I don’t think alcohol was a contributing factor. Whether he had a couple beers, that’s possible,” Ford said. “The best we can tell from his family and from his roommate’s family is that they were best friends.” Reader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.
