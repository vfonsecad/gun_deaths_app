Neighbors Shocked By Sterling Homicide                                   3 comments                                        As the Loudoun County Sheriff's Office continues its investigation into Thursday night's fatal shooting in Sterling, authorities have released the identity of the victim. Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Liz Mills said 30-year-old Jovaughn J. Johnson was found dead in his 2002 Mercedes Benz SUV in the area of Great Trail Terrace and Trail Run Terrace shortly before 7 p.m. Dec. 27. His death has been ruled a homicide. Johnson's SUV was parked just steps from a playground in a quiet neighborhood in Sterling, just off Rt. 28. A couple of nearby residents were at the site Friday morning, hanging a Bible verse near the site. The only indication that there had been a shooting there the night before was a small piece of police tape tied to a tree branch. The residents, who asked not to be named, said they never would have expected such a thing to happen in their neighborhood. "Everybody knows everybody around here," one woman said, wiping tears from her eyes. "A shooting? Here? It just doesn't make any sense." The woman, who said she knew the victim, described him as a "nice boy." This is the first homicide investigation worked by the sheriff's office in the county this year. While few details have been released about the case, investigators said the shooting does not appear to be a random act.Â  Investigators are asking for anyone with any information about the case, or those who may have seen suspicious activity in the area between 1 and 5 p.m. yesterday to call 703-777-0475. Callers who wish to remain anonymous should call Loudoun Crime Solvers at 703-777-1919. A $1,000 reward is offered in the case, if the information leads to an arrest and an indictment.

Or, use your          linked account:                          to the first post on this page, not all gun owners are gun nuts. our DOJ is scarier than the criminal public and they hide behind their shields and guns. i am not an nra member nor do i support them, but as a child they taught us gun safety in the boy scouts and morals, values, etc., which is missing is the liberal public school system that would rather teach non-traditional family values, global warming, etc. versus avoiding the gun situation as a whole because it is taboo. you really have no concept of the world around you, or the raw reality of statistics pertaining to guns, gun violence and homicides resulting from guns internationally. the one statistic that is never published pertains to the lives saved by legal gun owners. my life was saved twice and my families once during a buglary. had i been walking my children in the area when the man in the article was murdered, i would like to have been prepared versus in your world and just another statistic. as a hard working, white collar, tax paying citizen who has never broken the law (other than one ticket), i can't help the sheep like you, but would still gladly come to your aid when you are being attacked by a knife wielding or gun carrying thug and the police are nowhere to be found. you need to start with the #1 gun supporter in our country, mr harry reid who has directly and indirectly pushed more pro gun legislation. sad that a liberal is in bed with the nra.  .  Selective control of guns should happen. Automatic weapons and super magazines should not be options for the public.Trying to legislate guns away from owners is nothing more then pie in the sky. Restrict automatic guns for use by gun ranges and law enforcement. Anti gun nuts bring up everything but what is going on in this country. When somebody pushes for gun control without adding specifics then he is just looking to rabble rouse. They are part of the loonie fringe that does not see guns as a determent and a protection device. Anti gun for the wrong reasons is as bad as pro gun for the wrong reasons and it's not a coincidence. Bang, bang, you're dead. All over the country. Every day. All the other developed countries on earth have gun control. All the other developed countries in the world have lower murder rates. It's not a coincidence. The gun nuts will try to talk you to death on it, but don't let them confuse you. The Second Amendment is an oddball provision, an anachronism from the colonial days of no standing army. You don't find guns in other lists of fundamental rightsâbecause it's NOT a fundamental right. Stick with your own common sense. DON'T SIDE WITH THE GUN NUTS.Support the push for lower murder rates. Support for the push for GUN CONTROL.   www.leesburgtoday.com Leesburg Today OnlinePhone number: 703-771-8800E-mail: info@leesburgtoday.comAddress: 19 N.
