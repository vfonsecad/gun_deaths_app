He said those involved in the shooting were not town residents.     	It’s been nearly five years since someone was killed in Beulaville, Summerlin said.    	Tommy Atkinson, owner of Mom & Pop’s Grocery Store on N.C. 24, said violent crime was rare in the small town.    	“Every now and then it happens, but we ain’t nothing like Jacksonville and Greenville,” he said.    	Atkinson said he heard about the shooting Wednesday morning when he opened the store. He said everyone in town was talking about it.    	“It’s very seldom this sort of thing happens,” he said.    	Turner is accused of shooting Fountain on Bostic Street, behind the BB&T Bank and near a florist shop at 8 p.m. The police station is just a block away. A Beulaville police officer involved in a nearby traffic stop, heard the gunshot and responded, said Police Chief Joey Carter, using the terms suspect and victim.    	Fountain — still officially described only as a white man — died shortly after paramedics arrived, Carter said. Fountain’s age has not been confirmed.    	Turner appeared before a Duplin County District Court judge on Wednesday morning, and a bond hearing is set for Friday.    	Police are set to hold a press conference Thursday at 9 a.m. to provide information in the case.    	      	Contact Daily News Senior Reporter Lindell Kay at 910-219-8455 or lindell.kay@jdnews.com.
