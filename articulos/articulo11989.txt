Brunswick police arrested Samuel Tyrone Sallins, 25, at 8:40 Friday night on a murder charge, Capt. Kevin Jones said. Officers who responded to a 2:10 a.m. call of shots fired arrived in the westernmost block of G Street to find a man with a single gunshot wound, the Brunswick Police Department said in a release. The victim, Justin Lamar Carreker, 25, of Brunswick was taken to Southeast Georgia Health System’s Brunswick hospital, where he died shortly after his arrival, police said. Until noon, a full block of G Street between Newcastle and Reynolds streets was closed as investigators mapped the crime scene and searched for clues. The historic Glynn County courthouse is in the next block of G Street and the county’s Harold Pate Annex, jail and courthouse are a just a block away. Police found Carreker lying in a dirt lane that runs between an undeveloped lot and a commercial building. A man in a nearby business said he had been told that people had started congregating in the area after clubs closed at 2 a.m. There are no nightclubs within several blocks of the crime scene but a club that does not serve alcohol opened in the block several weeks ago. Carreker was lying a short distance from that business. Yellow plastic evidence markers sat near and on a sedan parked beside the building and in shrubbery about 100 feet to the west. Police searched trash bins, shrubbery and went over the lane several times.
