1 1 The Collier County Sheriff's Office is investigating a shooting that left one man dead and one critically injured, Saturday. Deputies say it happened around 12:30 a.m. on West Delaware Avenue. According to the sheriff's office, two men were sitting in a car when they got into an altercation with the unidentified male suspect. The suspect shot both men. 20-year-old Ernst Ganem was taken to the hospital where he later died from his injuries.  The other victim, Gotty Charles, 19, of Lehigh Acres, was taken to the hospital in critical condition. Deputies are still searching for the shooter. As the sun set Ganem's family and friends gathered to console his grieving mother.  "She can't stand up because you know something like this, he passed away, people take away his life like this so she can't stand up," said Hubermane Emilus, Ernst Stepfather. "My son has never been in trouble he never arrested, do drugs or anything like this," said Emilus.  He adds his son was a family man, and was with them just a few hours before he was killed.  "By the time I realized he had some friend pick him up going some place else I waited till six o' clock in the morning, by the time the sheriff comes in and lets me know Ernst had passed away," Emilus said.  Collier County deputies haven't released the name of the other victim.  He was transported from the scene to the hospital in critical condition.
