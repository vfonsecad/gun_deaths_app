Neighbors told police they saw two men fleeing the house at about 1:45 a.m. after the shots were fired, Police Major Arthur Martins said in a statement. The suspects' description was vague, the statement said, because it was dark outside. The victim was shot at least twice, he said. Investigators wearing blue Hazmat suits were seen entering the house and leaving with several boxes and a locked safe.  Assistant Attorney General Stacey Veroni confirmed that it was a homicide investigation, but would not release any further details.  The same Dawson Street address was the scene of a home invasion on May 21. It is not yet clear if it has any relation to Sunday's homicide.  Police are asking anyone with information about the incident to contact Pawtucket Police detectives at (401)277-9100.
