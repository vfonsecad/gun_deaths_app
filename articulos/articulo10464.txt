1 1  By Todd Feathers, Globe Correspondent A 23-year-old man was killed and a 22-year-old woman was injured early this morning when a state trooper fired several shots into their car during an altercation that broke out after a routine traffic stop near Chicopee, according to a statement from State Police. State Police said they were both Springfield residents, but did not identify them.  The pair were taken to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, where the man later died and the woman was treated and released, said State Police spokesman Dave Procopio in the statement.  The altercation began around 12:20 a.m. after the trooper, whose name has not been released, stopped a BMW allegedly speeding southbound on Route 91, near exit 8. When the trooper asked for the driverÃ¢ÂÂs license and registration, the man allegedly became combative, according to the statement. Procopio said that during the course of the struggle, the trooper fired his gun, hitting the man. The woman exited the vehicle after the shooting and cut her arm, he said. The trooper then returned to his cruiser and while he was reporting the incident on his radio, the man allegedly began driving away in the BMW, according to the statement. The trooper followed the car for two-tenths of a mile until it crashed into a barrier at the base of exit 2, according to the statement. Upon searching the car, troopers allegedly found a loaded 25-caliber handgun and a loaded 40-caliber handgun, both of which had their serial numbers scratched out, according to the statement. Procopio said the trooper, who joined the State Police last year, has been placed on administrative leave, according to protocol in such cases. Hampden District Attorney Mark MastroianniÃ¢ÂÂs office is investigating the shooting. The office  did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
